## Title  
**PVLens: Enhancing Pharmacovigilance Through Automated Label Extraction**

## Authors  
Jeffery L. Painter, Greg Powell, and Andrew Bate

## Abstract

Reliable drug safety reference databases are essential for pharmacovigilance, yet existing resources like SIDER are outdated and static. We introduce PVLens, an automated system that extracts labeled safety information from FDA Structured Product Labels (SPLs) and maps terms to MedDRA. PVLens integrates automation with expert oversight through a web-based review tool. In validation against 97 drug labels, PVLens achieved an F1 score of 0.882, with high recall (0.983) and moderate precision (0.799). By offering a scalable, more accurate and continuously updated alternative to SIDER, PVLens enhances real-time pharamcovigilance with improved accuracy and contemporaneous insights.

---

This repository contains the original source data used in the validation of the **PVLens** pipeline for extracting indications, adverse events, and black box warnings from FDA Structured Product Labels (SPLs).

# 📁 Directory Structure

## Src

Contains the R script 'data_analysis.R' that can be run to recreate all statistics reported in the manuscript. It creates additional figures that were not included in the final paper due to space limitations.

## Data

- **dictionary/**: Contains mapping files like `guid_to_xml.csv`, which links each GUID to its corresponding SPL XML filename and the unique SPL_ID assigned in our review database. 'meddra.csv' contains the subset of meddra codes identified in the labels for this review - the ID column can be linked to MEDDRA_CODE in the other tables to identify the exact MedDRA terms evaluated.
- **extracted_labels/**: Output of the PVLens pipeline, split into three sub-directories:
  - `indications/`
  - `aes/` (adverse events)
  - `blackbox/` (black box warnings)  
  Each contains one `.txt` file per SPL, named by GUID.
- **src_labels/**: The original XML files of SPLs downloaded from the FDA and used as the input source for PVLens.
- **review_results/**: Contains the manual review data used for the analysis in the manuscript.

## Figures

The figures generated by the R script are found in this directory.

# 📌 Notes
- Last update contains 97 SPL labels that have been manually reviewed and adjudicated.
- The `extracted_labels/` directory includes the output of PVLens categorized by label type.
- All GUIDs correspond to entries in `guid_to_xml.csv` for traceability.

# 🧪 Getting Started (Python)

To help reviewers and collaborators explore the processed data without needing to manage Excel files, we’ve provided a Python notebook:

### ➤ File: `data_exploration_example.ipynb`

This notebook walks through:
- Loading MedDRA, GUID mappings, and manually reviewed terms
- Joining section text (AE, BlackBox, Indication) with reviewer assessments
- Creating a consolidated `spl_mapped_terms` DataFrame for analysis
- Plotting summary figures to compare `INCLUDE` status across sections

### ➤ How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jlpainter/AMIA2025.git
   cd pvlens-data-exploration
