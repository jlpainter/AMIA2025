                        <paragraph>Determine the number of vials to be diluted based on the individual patientâs weight and the recommended dose of 2 mg/kg.Â  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Dilute the calculated dose to a final volume of 100 mL or 250 mL using 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.Â  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The final volume is based on the patientâs weight as follows:Â  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â·Â For patients who weigh less than 25 kg, the final volume should be 100 mL;</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Â·Â For patients who weigh 25 kg or more, the final volume should be 250 mL.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The solution should be clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow when diluted.Â  Do not use if the solution is discolored or if there is particulate matter in the solution. Note that a diluted solution with slight flocculation (e.g., thin translucent fibers) is acceptable for administration. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Avoid agitation during preparation.Â  Gently rotate the bag to ensure proper distribution.Â  Do not shake the solution.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.1 Anaphylaxis andÂ Hypersensitivity Reactions</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients treated with Vimizim. In premarketing clinical trials, 18 of 235 (7.7%) patients treated with Vimizim experienced signs and symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis. These 18 patients experienced 26 anaphylactic reactions during infusion with signs and symptoms including cough, erythema, throat tightness, urticaria, flushing, cyanosis, hypotension, rash, dyspnea, chest discomfort, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, abdominal pain, retching, and vomiting) in conjunction with urticaria. These cases of anaphylaxis occurred as early as 30 minutes from the start of infusion and up to three hours after infusion.Â  Anaphylaxis occurred as late into treatment as the 47<sup>th</sup> infusion.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In clinical trials with Vimizim, 44 of 235 (18.7%) patients experienced hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred as early as 30 minutes from the start of infusion but as late as six days after infusion. Frequent symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions (occurring in more than 2 patients) included anaphylactic reactions, urticaria, peripheral edema, cough, dyspnea, and flushing. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Due to the potential for anaphylaxis, appropriate medical support should be readily available when Vimizim is administered. Observe patients closely for an appropriate period of time after administration of Vimizim, taking into account the time to onset of anaphylaxis seen in premarketing clinical trials. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur.Â  </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because of the potential for hypersensitivity reactions, administer antihistamines with or without antipyretics prior to infusion. Management of hypersensitivity reactions should be based on the severity of the reaction and include slowing or temporary interruption of the infusion and/or administration of additional antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids for mild reactions. However, if severe hypersensitivity reactions occur, immediately stop the infusion of Vimizim and initiate appropriate treatment. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Consider the risks and benefits of re-administering Vimizim following a severe reaction.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of Vimizim was conducted in 176Â patients with MPS IVA, ages 5 to 57 years old. Â Approximately half of the patients (49%) were male.Â  Of the 176 patients, 65% were White, 23% Asian, 3% Black, and 10% Other race.Â  The majority of patients (78%) were non-Hispanic. Patients were randomized to three treatment groups:Â  Vimizim 2Â mg/kg once per week (n=58), Vimizim 2 mg/kg once every other week (n=59), or placebo (n=59).Â  All patients were treated with antihistamines prior to each infusion.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other elosulfase alfa products may be misleading.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All patients treated with Vimizim 2 mg/kg once per week in the placebo-controlled trial developed antidrug antibodies by Week 4. Anti-drug antibody titers were sustained or increased for the duration of Vimizim treatment. Because all patients developed anti-drug antibodies, associations between antibody titers and reductions in treatment effect or the occurrence of anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions could not be determined.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>All patients treated with Vimizim 2 mg/kg once per week tested positive for neutralizing antibodies capable of inhibiting the drug from binding to the mannose-6-phosphate receptor at least once during the trial. Binding to this receptor is required for Vimizim to be taken into cells where it is active. Â Neutralizing antibody titers were not determined in the patients.Â  Therefore, the possibility of an association between neutralizing antibody titer and treatment effect cannot be assessed. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Available data from published case reports and postmarketing experience with Vimizim use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, no effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in rats given daily administration of elosulfase alfa up to 33 times the human steady-state AUC (area under the concentration-time curve) at the recommended human weekly dose premating and through the period of organogenesis. No effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in rabbits given daily administration of elosulfase alfa at doses up to 8 times the human steady-state AUC at the recommended weekly dose during organogenesis, which produced maternal toxicity. A dose-dependent increase in stillbirths was observed when elosulfase alfa was administered daily in rats during organogenesis through lactation at doses 5 times the human steady-state AUC at the recommended human weekly dose. An increase in pup mortality was observed at doses producing maternal toxicity.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>All reproductive studies with rats included pre-treatment with diphenhydramine to prevent or minimize hypersensitivity reactions.Â  The effects of elosulfase alfa were evaluated based on comparison to a control group treated with diphenhydramine alone.Â  Daily intravenous administration of up to 20 mg/kg elosulfase alfa in rats (33 times the human steady-state AUC at the recommended weekly dose of 2Â mg/kg) during a 15-day pre-mating period, mating, and the period of organogenesis, produced no maternal toxicity or effects on embryo-fetal development.Â  Daily intravenous administration of up to 10Â mg/kg in rabbits (8 times the human steady-state AUC at the recommended weekly dose) during the period of organogenesis had no effects on embryo-fetal development.Â  However, maternal toxicity (gross changes in liver) was observed in rabbits given doses of 1 mg/kg/day and higher (0.1 times the human steady-state AUC at the recommended weekly dose).Â  Elosulfase alfa produced an increase in the percentage of stillbirths when administered daily to rats at intravenous doses of 6 mg/kg and higher (5 times the human steady-state AUC at the recommended weekly dose) during the period of organogenesis through lactation.Â  Daily intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg (33 times the human steady-state AUC at the recommended weekly dose) produced maternal toxicity and an increase in mortality of offspring during the lactation period.Â  This study lacked a full evaluation of neurodevelopmental milestones; however, no effects of elosulfase alfa were noted in tests for learning and memory.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Vimizim is a formulation of elosulfase alfa, which is a purified human enzyme produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Human N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.4) is a hydrolytic lysosomal glycosaminoglycan-specific enzyme that hydrolyzes sulfate from either galactose-6-sulfate or N-acetyl-galactosamine-6-sulfate on the non-reducing ends of the glycosaminoglycans keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitin-6-sulfate (C6S). </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Elosulfase alfa is a soluble glycosylated dimeric protein with two oligosaccharide chains per monomer. Each monomeric peptide chain contains 496 amino acids and has an approximate molecular mass of 55Â kDa (59 kDa including the oligosaccharides). One of the oligosaccharide chains contains bis-mannose-6-phosphate (bisM6P). bisM6P binds a receptor at the cell surface and the binding mediates cellular uptake of the protein to the lysosome. Â Elosulfase alfa has a specific activity of 2.6 to 6.0 units/mg. One activity unit is defined as the amount of the enzyme required to convert 1 micromole of sulfated monosaccharide substrate D-galactopyranoside-6-sulfate (Gal-6S) to de-sulfated-galactose (Gal) and free sulfate per minute at 37Â°C.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Vimizim is intended for intravenous infusion and is supplied as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, colorless to pale yellow, clear to slightly opalescent solution that must be diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP prior to administration. Vimizim is supplied in clear Type 1 glass 5 mL vials. Each vial provides 5Â mg elosulfase alfa, 31.6 mg L-arginine hydrochloride, 0.5 mg polysorbateÂ 20, 13.6 mg sodium acetate trihydrate, 34.5 mg sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, and 100 mg sorbitol in a 5 mL extractable solution with a pH between 5.0 to 5.8. Vimizim does not contain preservatives. Each vial is for single use only.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Mucopolysaccharidoses comprise a group of lysosomal storage disorders caused by the deficiency of specific lysosomal enzymes required for the catabolism of glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA, Morquio A Syndrome) is characterized by the absence or marked reduction in <content styleCode="italics">N</content>-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase activity. The sulfatase activity deficiency results in the accumulation of the GAG substrates, KS and C6S, in the lysosomal compartment of cells throughout the body. The accumulation leads to widespread cellular, tissue, and organ dysfunction.Â  Vimizim is intended to provide the exogenous enzyme N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase that will be taken up into the lysosomes and increase the catabolism of the GAGs KS and C6S.Â  Elosulfase alfa uptake by cells into lysosomes is mediated by the binding of mannose-6-phosphate-terminated oligosaccharide chains of elosulfase alfa to mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In the absence of an animal disease model that recapitulates the human disease phenotype, elosulfase alfa pharmacological activity was evaluated using human primary chondrocytes from two MPS IVA patients. Treatment of MPS IVA chondrocytes with elosulfase alfa induced clearance of KS lysosomal storage from the chondrocytes. </paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacokinetics of elosulfase alfa were evaluated in 23 patients with MPS IVA who received intravenous infusions ofÂ  Vimizim 2 mg/kg once weekly, over approximately 4 hours, for 22 weeks. Eleven patients were aged 5 to 11 years, six were aged 12 to 17 years, and six were aged 18 to 41 years. Â Table 2 summarizes the pharmacokinetic parameters at Week 0 and Week 22. Mean AUC<sub>0ât</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> increased to 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively, at Week 22 compared to Week 0. Â Mean t<sub>1/2 </sub>increased from 7.5 min at Week 0 to 35.9 min at Week 22. These changes are likely related to the development of neutralizing antibodies in all patients. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of Vimizim were assessed in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 176Â patients with MPS IVA. The age of patients ranged from 5 to 57Â years. The majority of the patients (82%) presented with a medical history of musculoskeletal conditions, which includes knee deformity (52%), kyphosis (31%), hip dysplasia (22%), prior spinal fusion surgery (22%) and arthralgia (20%). At baseline, all enrolled patients could walk more than 30Â meters (m) but less than 325Â m in six minutes.Â  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Patients received Vimizim 2Â mg/kg once per week (n=58), Vimizim 2 mg/kg once every other week (n=59), or placebo (n=59).Â  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in the distance walked in six minutes (six minute walk test, 6-MWT) at WeekÂ 24. The other endpoints included changes from baseline in the rate of stair climbing in three minutes (three-minute stair climb test, 3-MSCT) and changes from baseline in urine KS levels at WeekÂ 24. The treatment effect in the distance walked in 6Â minutes, compared to placebo, was 22.5 m (CI<sub>95</sub>, 4.0, 40.9; p=0.0174) in patients who received Vimizim 2 mg/kg once per week. There was no difference in the rate of stair climbing between patients who received Vimizim 2 mg/kg once per week and those who received placebo. Patients who received Vimizim 2Â mg/kg once every other week performed similarly in the 6-MWT and 3-MSCT as those who received placebo. The reduction in urinary KS levels from baseline, a measure of pharmacodynamic effect, was greater in the Vimizim treatment groups compared to placebo.Â  The relationship between urinary KS and other measures of clinical response has not been established.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Advise the patients and caregivers that reactions related to administration and infusion may occur during Vimizim treatment, including life-threatening anaphylaxis.Â  Patients who have experienced anaphylactic reactions may require observation during and after Vimizim administration. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and have them seek immediate medical care should symptoms occur.Â  The risks and benefits of re-administering Vimizim following a severe reaction should be considered. Patients with acute respiratory illness may be at risk of serious acute exacerbation of their respiratory compromise due to hypersensitivity reactions. Â Pre-medication and reduction of infusion rate may alleviate those reactions associated with the infusion <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_f26e1ef7-ba4f-46c9-95be-cc670a147791">5.1</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#LINK_48192839-a126-4e4f-b1a8-d7228a7b7acc">5.2</linkHtml>)].</content>

The Morquio A Registry will also monitor the effect of Vimizim on pregnant women, lactating women and their infants, and determine if Vimizim is present in breast milk. Patients should be encouraged to participate in the MARS and advised that their participation is voluntary and may involve long-term follow-up.
