                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Aspirin is associated with serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions, including inflammation, bleeding ulceration and perforation of the upper and lower GI tract. Other adverse reactions with aspirin include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serious GI adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA were: gastric ulcer hemorrhage in one of the 521 patients treated with ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA and duodenal ulcer hemorrhage in one of the 524 patients treated with enteric-coated aspirin. In addition, there were two cases of intestinal hemorrhage, one in each treatment group, and one patient treated with ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA experienced obstruction of the small bowel.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, monitor patients for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI adverse reactions.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>If active and clinically significant bleeding from any source occurs in patients receiving ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, discontinue treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Avoid concomitant use of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA with clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is a prodrug. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite. The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by use with concomitant medications, such as omeprazole, that interfere with CYP2C19 activity. Co-administration of clopidogrel with 80 mg omeprazole reduces the pharmacological activity of clopidogrel, even when administered 12 hours apart. When using ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, consider alternative anti-platelet therapy <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S7">Drug Interactions (7)</linkHtml>, <linkHtml href="#S12.3">Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)</linkHtml>].</content>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including omeprazole. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE), and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly.Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment, but some cases occurred days or years after initiating treatment. SLE occurred primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serologicial testing (e.g., ANA) may be positive and elevated serologicial test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Aspirin, a component of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, should be avoided 1 week prior to and during labor and delivery because it can result in excessive blood loss at delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDS, including aspirin, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.</paragraph>

                                          <paragraph>Data from several controlled and observational studies with aspirin use in the first or second trimesters of pregnancy have not reported a clear association with major birth defects or miscarriage risk. Published data on aspirin use during pregnancy has been mostly reported with low dose aspirin (60 to 100 mg). There are limited data regarding aspirin 325 mg or higher doses used during pregnancy.</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>A prospective, cohort study of 50,282 mother-child pairs (the Collaborative Perinatal Project) assessing adverse outcomes by level of aspirin exposure did not report aspirin-induced teratogenicity, altered neonatal birth weight, or perinatal deaths at any exposure level. In a controlled, randomized trial, maternal risks during pregnancy were reported as low or absent, with no demonstrated increased risk of maternal bleeding or placental abruptio. A multinational study involving more than 9,000 women, CLASP (Collaborative Low-dose Aspirin Study in Pregnancy)], found that low-dose aspirin reduced fetal morbidity in a select population of women with early-onset preeclampsia, but did not identify adverse effects in the pregnant woman, fetus, or newborn (followed to 12 and 18 months of age) in association with the use of low-dose aspirin during pregnancy. In contrast, some case-control studies reported associations between human congenital malformations and aspirin use early in gestation, but these studies did not report a consistent outcome attributable to drug use.</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>A report from EAGeR trial (Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction trial), which evaluated 1078 women who were attempting to become pregnant and had prior miscarriages, reported use of low-dose aspirin without adverse maternal or fetal effects except for vaginal bleeding. Another trial of 3294 pregnant women of 14 to 20 weeks of gestation treated with aspirin showed no effect in the mothers' incidence of pre-eclampsia, hypertension, HELLP syndrome or placental abruptio, or in the incidence of perinatal deaths or low birth weight below the 10th percentile. The incidence of maternal side effects was higher in the aspirin group, principally because of a significantly higher rate of hemorrhage.</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>Use of NSAIDs, including aspirin, during the third trimester of pregnancy increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and use of high-dose aspirin for long periods in pregnancy may also increase the risk of bleeding in the brain of premature infants.</paragraph>

                                          <paragraph>Four published epidemiological studies compared the frequency of congenital abnormalities among infants born to women who used omeprazole during pregnancy with the frequency of abnormalities among infants of women exposed to H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists or other controls.</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>A population-based retrospective cohort epidemiological study from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry, covering approximately 99% of pregnancies, from 1995 to 1999, reported on 955 infants (824 exposed during the first trimester with 39 of these exposed beyond first trimester, and 131 exposed after the first trimester) whose mothers used omeprazole during pregnancy. The number of infants exposed in utero to omeprazole that had any malformation, low birth weight, low Apgar score, or hospitalization was similar to the number observed in this population. The number of infants born with ventricular septal defects and the number of stillborn infants was slightly higher in the omeprazole-exposed infants than the expected number in this population.</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>A population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2009, reported on 1,800 live births whose mothers used omeprazole during the first trimester of pregnancy and 837,317 live births whose mothers did not use any PPI. The overall rate of birth defects in infants born to mothers with first trimester exposure to omeprazole was 2.9% and 2.6% in infants born to mothers not exposed to any proton pump inhibitor during the first trimester.</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>A retrospective cohort study reported on 689 pregnant women exposed to either H2-blockers or omeprazole in the first trimester (134 exposed to omeprazole) and 1,572 pregnant women unexposed to either during the first trimester. The overall malformation rate in offspring born to mothers with first trimester exposure to omeprazole, an H<sub>2</sub>-blocker, or were unexposed was 3.6%, 5.5%, and 4.1% respectively.</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>A small prospective observational cohort study followed 113 women exposed to omeprazole during pregnancy (89% with first trimester exposures). The reported rate of major congenital malformations was 4% in the omeprazole group, 2% in controls exposed to non-teratogens, and 2.8% in disease-paired controls. Rates of spontaneous and elective abortions, preterm deliveries, gestational age at delivery, and mean birth weight were similar among the groups.</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>Several studies have reported no apparent adverse short-term effects on the infant when single dose oral or intravenous omeprazole was administered to over 200 pregnant women as premedication for cesarean section under general anesthesia.</paragraph>

                                          <paragraph>Aspirin produced a spectrum of developmental anomalies when administered to Wistar rats as single, large doses (500 to 625 mg/kg) on gestational day (GD) 9, 10, or 11. These doses (500 to 625 mg/kg) in rats are about 15 to 19 times the maximum recommended human dose of aspirin (325 mg/day) based on body surface area. Many of the anomalies were related to closure defects and included craniorachischisis, gastroschisis and umbilical hernia, and cleft lip, in addition to diaphragmatic hernia, heart malrotation, and supernumerary ribs and kidneys. In contrast to the rat, aspirin was not developmentally toxic in rabbits.</paragraph>

                                          <paragraph>Reproductive studies conducted with omeprazole in rats at oral doses up to 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) and in rabbits at doses up to 69.1 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) during organogenesis did not disclose any evidence for a teratogenic potential of omeprazole. In rabbits, omeprazole in a dose range of 6.9 to 69.1 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) administered during organogenesis produced dose-related increases in embryo-lethality, fetal resorptions, and pregnancy disruptions. In rats, dose-related embryo/fetal toxicity and postnatal developmental toxicity were observed in offspring resulting from parents treated with omeprazole at 13.8 to 138 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 34 times an oral human doses of 40 mg on a body surface area basis), administered prior to mating through the lactation period.</paragraph>

The animal to human dose multiples are based on the assumption of equal systemic exposure to esomeprazole in humans following oral administration of either 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole.</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>No effects on embryo-fetal development were observed in reproduction studies with esomeprazole magnesium in rats at oral doses up to 280 mg/kg/day (about 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) or in rabbits at oral doses up to 86 mg/kg/day (about 42 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a body surface area basis) administered during organogenesis.</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>A pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats with additional endpoints to evaluate bone development was performed with esomeprazole magnesium at oral doses of 14 to 280 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a body surface area basis). Neonatal/early postnatal (birth to weaning) survival was decreased at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a body surface area basis). Body weight and body weight gain were reduced and neurobehavioral or general developmental delays in the immediate post-weaning timeframe were evident at doses equal to or greater than 69 mg/kg/day (about 17 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a body surface area basis). In addition, decreased femur length, width and thickness of cortical bone, decreased thickness of the tibial growth plate and minimal to mild bone marrow hypocellularity were noted at doses equal to or greater than 14 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a body surface area basis).</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>Physeal dysplasia in the femur was observed in offspring of rats treated with oral doses of esomeprazole magnesium at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a body surface area basis).</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>Effects on maternal bone were observed in pregnant and lactating rats in the pre- and postnatal toxicity study when esomeprazole magnesium was administered at oral doses of 14 to 280 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a body surface area basis). When rats were dosed from gestational day 7 through weaning on postnatal day 21, a statistically significant decrease in maternal femur weight of up to 14% (as compared to placebo treatment) was observed at doses equal to or greater than 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times an oral human dose of 40 mg esomeprazole or 40 mg omeprazole on a body surface area basis).</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>A pre- and postnatal development study in rats with esomeprazole strontium (using equimolar doses compared to esomeprazole magnesium study) produced similar results in dams and pups as described above.</paragraph>
                                          <paragraph>A follow up developmental toxicity study in rats with further time points to evaluate pup bone development from postnatal day 2 to adulthood was performed with esomeprazole magnesium at oral doses of 280 mg/kg/day (about 68 times an oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis) where esomeprazole administration was from either gestational day 7 or gestational day 16 until parturition. When maternal administration was confined to gestation only, there were no effects on bone physeal morphology in the offspring at any age.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>There is no information about the presence of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA in human milk; however, the individual components of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, aspirin and omeprazole, are present in human milk. Limited data from clinical lactation studies in published literature describe the presence of aspirin in human milk at relative infant doses of 2.5% to 10.8% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. Case reports of breastfeeding infants whose mothers were exposed to aspirin during lactation describe adverse reactions, including metabolic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, and hemolysis. There is no information on the effects of aspirin on milk production. Limited data from a case report in published literature describes the presence of omeprazole in human milk at a relative infant dose of 0.9% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage. There are no reports of adverse effects of omeprazole on the breastfed infant, and no information on the effects of omeprazole on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including the potential for aspirin to cause metabolic acidosis, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis or Reye's syndrome, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA.</paragraph>

Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also demonstrated a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Reports have been received of overdosage with omeprazole in humans. Doses ranged up to 2400 mg. Manifestations were variable, but included confusion, drowsiness, blurred vision, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, flushing, headache, dry mouth, and other adverse reactions similar to those seen with recommended doses of omeprazole <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S6">Adverse Reactions (6)</linkHtml>].</content> Symptoms were transient, and no serious clinical outcome has been reported when omeprazole was taken alone. No specific antidote for omeprazole overdosage is known. Omeprazole is extensively protein bound and is, therefore, not readily dialyzable. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive.</paragraph>

               <title>11 DESCRIPTION</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>The active ingredients of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA are aspirin which is an antiplatelet agent and omeprazole which is a PPI.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA (aspirin and omeprazole) is an oval, blue-green, multi-layer film-coated, delayed-release tablet consists of an enteric coated delayed-release aspirin core surrounded by an immediate-release omeprazole layer for oral administration. Each delayed-release tablet contains either 81 mg aspirin and 40 mg omeprazole printed with 81/40, or 325 mg aspirin and 40 mg omeprazole printed with 325/40.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The excipients used in the formulation of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA are all inactive and United States Pharmacopeia/National Formulary (USP/NF) defined. The inactive ingredients in ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA include: carnauba wax, colloidal silicon dioxide, corn starch, FD&amp;C Blue #2, glyceryl monostearate, hydroxypropyl methycellulose, methacrylic acid copolymer dispersion, microcrystalline cellulose, polydextrose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, povidone, pre-gelatinized starch, sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous, stearic acid, talc, titanium dioxide, triacetin, triethyl citrate, yellow iron oxide.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Aspirin is acetylsalicylic acid and is chemically known as benzoic acid, 2-(acetyloxy). Aspirin is an odorless white needle-like crystalline or powdery substance. When exposed to moisture, aspirin hydrolyzes into salicylic and acetic acids and gives off a vinegary odor. It is highly lipid soluble and slightly soluble in water. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits platelet COX-1.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Omeprazole is a white to off-white crystalline powder which melts with decomposition at about 155Â°C. It is a weak base, freely soluble in ethanol and methanol, and slightly soluble in acetone and isopropanol and very slightly soluble in water. The stability of omeprazole is a function of pH; it is rapidly degraded in acid media, but has acceptable stability under alkaline conditions.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Omeprazole is a substituted benzimidazole, 5-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3, 5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl) methyl] sulfinyl]-1<content styleCode="italics">H</content>- benzimidazole, a compound that inhibits gastric acid secretion.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is an inhibitor of both prostaglandin synthesis and platelet aggregation. The differences in activity between aspirin and salicylic acid are thought to be due to the acetyl group on the aspirin molecule. This acetyl group is responsible for the inactivation of cyclo-oxygenase via acetylation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Omeprazole belongs to a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that suppress gastric acid secretion by specific inhibition of the [H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>]-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. Because this enzyme system is regarded as the acid (proton) pump within the gastric mucosa, omeprazole has been characterized as a gastric acid-pump inhibitor, in that it blocks the final step of acid production. This effect is dose-related and leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Aspirin affects platelet aggregation by irreversibly inhibiting prostaglandin cyclo-oxygenase. This effect lasts for the life of the platelet and prevents the formation of the platelet aggregating factor thromboxane A2. Nonacetylated salicylates do not inhibit this enzyme and have no effect on platelet aggregation. At higher doses, aspirin reversibly inhibits the formation of prostaglandin I<sub>2</sub> (prostacyclin), which is an arterial vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Human gastric biopsy specimens have been obtained from more than 3000 patients treated with omeprazole in long-term clinical trials. The incidence of ECL cell hyperplasia in these studies increased with time; however, no case of ECL cell carcinoids, dysplasia, or neoplasia has been found in these patients. However, these studies are of insufficient duration and size to rule out the possible influence of long-term administration of omeprazole on the development of any premalignant or malignant conditions.</paragraph>

In healthy subjects, a single intravenous dose of omeprazole (0.35 mg/kg) had no effect on intrinsic factor secretion. No systematic dose-dependent effect has been observed on basal or stimulated pepsin output in humans. However, when intragastric pH is maintained at 4.0 or above, basal pepsin output is low, and pepsin activity is decreased.</paragraph>

The remainder of the dose was recoverable in feces. This implies a significant biliary excretion of the metabolites of omeprazole. Three metabolites have been identified in plasma â€” the sulfide and sulfone derivatives of omeprazole, and hydroxyomeprazole. These metabolites have very little or no antisecretory activity.

                        <paragraph>CYP2C19, a polymorphic enzyme, is involved in the metabolism of omeprazole. The CYP2C19*1 allele is fully functional while the CYP2C19*2 and *3 alleles are nonfunctional. There are other alleles associated with no or reduced enzymatic function. Patients carrying two fully functional alleles are extensive metabolizers and those carrying two loss-of-function alleles are poor metabolizers. In extensive metabolizers, omeprazole is primarily metabolized by CYP2C19. The systemic exposure to omeprazole varies with a patient's metabolism status: poor metabolizers &gt; intermediate metabolizers &gt; extensive metabolizers. Approximately 3% of Caucasians and 15 to 20% of Asians are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a pharmacokinetic study of single 20 mg omeprazole dose, the AUC of omeprazole in Asian subjects was approximately four-fold of that in Caucasians <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#S8.8">Use in Specific Populations (8.8)</linkHtml>].</content>

                              <paragraph>In two 24-month carcinogenicity studies in rats, omeprazole at daily doses of 1.7, 3.4, 13.8, 44.0 and 140.8 mg/kg/day (about 0.35 to 34 times the human dose of 40 mg per day, based on body surface area) produced gastric ECL cell carcinoids in a dose-related manner in both male and female rats; the incidence of this effect was markedly higher in female rats, which had higher blood levels of omeprazole. Gastric carcinoids seldom occur in the untreated rat. In addition, ECL cell hyperplasia was present in all treated groups of both sexes. In one of these studies, female rats were treated with 13.8 mg omeprazole/kg/day (about 3.4 times the human dose of 40 mg per day, based on body surface area) for one year, then followed for an additional year without the drug. No carcinoids were seen in these rats. An increased incidence of treatment-related ECL cell hyperplasia was observed at the end of one year (94% treated vs 10% controls). By the second year the difference between treated and control rats was much smaller (46% vs 26%) but still showed more hyperplasia in the treated group. Gastric adenocarcinoma was seen in one rat (2%). No similar tumor was seen in male or female rats treated for two years. For this strain of rat no similar tumor has been noted historically, but a finding involving only one tumor is difficult to interpret. In a 52-week toxicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, brain astrocytomas were found in a small number of males that received omeprazole at dose levels of 0.4, 2, and 16 mg/kg/day (about 0.1 to 3.2 times the human dose of 40 mg/day, based on body surface area). No astrocytomas were observed in female rats in this study. In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, no astrocytomas were found in males and females at the high dose of 140.8 mg/kg/day (about 34 times the human dose of 40 mg per day, based on body surface area). A 78-week mouse carcinogenicity study of omeprazole did not show increased tumor occurrence, but the study was not conclusive. A 26-week p53 (+/-) transgenic mouse carcinogenicity study was not positive.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>In 24-month carcinogenicity studies in rats, a dose-related significant increase in gastric carcinoid tumors and ECL cell hyperplasia was observed in both male and female animals. Carcinoid tumors have also been observed in rats subjected to fundectomy or long-term treatment with other proton pump inhibitors or high doses of H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists.</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>Reproductive studies conducted with omeprazole in rats at oral doses up to 138 mg/kg/day (about 34 times the human dose on a body surface area basis) and in rabbits at doses up to 69 mg/kg/day (about 34 times the human dose on a body surface area basis) did not disclose any evidence for a teratogenic potential of omeprazole. In rabbits, omeprazole in a dose range of 6.9 to 69.1 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 34 times the human dose on a body surface area basis) produced dose-related increases in embryo-lethality, fetal resorptions, and pregnancy disruptions. In rats, dose-related embryo/fetal toxicity and postnatal developmental toxicity were observed in offspring resulting from parents treated with omeprazole at 13.8 to 138.0 mg/kg/day (about 3.4 to 34 times the human doses on a body surface area basis).</paragraph>

                                    <paragraph>A 28-day toxicity study with a 14-day recovery phase was conducted in juvenile rats with esomeprazole magnesium at oral doses of 70 to 280 mg/kg/day (about 17 to 67 times a daily oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis). An increase in the number of deaths at the high dose of 280 mg/kg/day was observed when juvenile rats were administered esomeprazole magnesium from postnatal day 7 through postnatal day 35. In addition, doses equal to or greater than 140 mg/kg/day (about 34 times a daily oral human dose of 40 mg on a body surface area basis), produced treatment-related decreases in body weight (approximately 14%) and body weight gain, decreases in femur weight and femur length, and affected overall growth. Comparable findings described above have also been observed in this study with another esomeprazole salt, esomeprazole strontium, at equimolar doses of esomeprazole.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Two randomized, multi-center, double-blind trials (Study 1 and Study 2) evaluated the omeprazole component by comparing the incidence of gastric ulcer formation in 524 patients randomized to ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA 325 mg/40 mg tablets and 525 patients randomized to EC-aspirin 325 mg. Patients were included with a cerebro- or cardiovascular diagnosis if they had been taking daily aspirin 325 mg for at least 3 months, were expected to require daily aspirin 325 mg therapy for at least 6 months and were over 55 years old. Subjects between 18 and 55 years old were also required to have a documented history of gastric or duodenal ulcer within the past 5 years. The majority of patients were male (71%) and white (90%). The majority (57%) of patients were â‰¥65 years of age. Approximately 11% were also on chronic NSAID therapy.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Studies 1 and 2 showed that ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA given as 325 mg/40 mg tablets once daily statistically significantly reduced the 6-month cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers compared to EC-aspirin 325 mg once daily. The results at one month, three months, and six months treatment are presented in Table 4.</paragraph>
