                     <title>5.1 Elevated Liver Enzymes</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Increases in ALT and AST &gt;3 Ã ULN have been reported in patients treated with ESBRIET.  Rarely these have been associated with concomitant elevations in bilirubin.  Patients treated with ESBRIET 2403 mg/day in the three Phase 3 trials had a higher incidence of elevations in ALT or AST â¥3 Ã ULN than placebo patients (3.7% vs. 0.8%, respectively).  Elevations â¥10 Ã ULN in ALT or AST occurred in 0.3% of patients in the ESBRIET 2403 mg/day group and in 0.2% of patients in the placebo group.  Increases in ALT and AST â¥3 Ã ULN were reversible with dose modification or treatment discontinuation.  No cases of liver transplant or death due to liver failure that were related to ESBRIET have been  reported.  However, the combination of transaminase elevations and elevated bilirubin without evidence of obstruction is generally recognized as an important predictor of severe liver injury, that could lead to death or the need for liver transplants in some patients.  Conduct liver function tests (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) prior to the initiation of therapy with ESBRIET in all patients, then monthly for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter.  Dosage modifications or interruption may be necessary for liver enzyme elevations <content styleCode="italics">

                        <paragraph>Patients treated with ESBRIET 2403 mg/day in the three Phase 3 studies had a higher incidence of photosensitivity reactions (9%) compared with patients treated with placebo (1%).  The majority of the photosensitivity reactions occurred during the initial 6 months.  Instruct patients to avoid or minimize exposure to sunlight (including sunlamps), to use a sunblock (SPF 50 or higher), and to wear clothing that protects against sun exposure.  Additionally, instruct patients to avoid concomitant medications known to cause photosensitivity.  Dosage reduction or discontinuation may be necessary in some cases of photosensitivity reaction or rash <content styleCode="italics">

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In the clinical studies, gastrointestinal events of nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, vomiting, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and abdominal pain were more frequently reported by patients in the ESBRIET treatment groups than in those taking placebo.  Dosage reduction or interruption for gastrointestinal events was required in 18.5% of patients in the 2403 mg/day group, as compared to 5.8% of patients in the placebo group; 2.2% of patients in the ESBRIET 2403 mg/day group discontinued treatment due to a gastrointestinal event, as compared to 1.0% in the placebo group.  The most common (&gt;2%) gastrointestinal events that led to dosage reduction or interruption were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and dyspepsia.  The incidence of gastrointestinal events was highest early in the course of treatment (with highest incidence occurring during the initial 3 months) and decreased over time.  Dosage modifications may be necessary in some cases of gastrointestinal adverse reactions <content styleCode="italics">

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety of pirfenidone has been evaluated in more than 1400 subjects with over 170 subjects exposed to pirfenidone for more than 5 years in clinical trials.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>ESBRIET was studied in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3) in which a total of 623 patients received 2403 mg/day of ESBRIET and 624 patients received placebo.  Subjects ages ranged from 40 to 80 years (mean age of 67 years).  Most patients were male (74%) and Caucasian (95%).  The mean duration of exposure to ESBRIET was 62 weeks (range: 2 to 118 weeks) in these 3 trials. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>At the recommended dosage of 2403 mg/day, 14.6% of patients on ESBRIET compared to 9.6% on placebo permanently discontinued treatment because of an adverse event.  The most common (&gt;1%) adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were rash and nausea.  The most common (&gt;3%) adverse reactions leading to dosage reduction or interruption were rash, nausea, diarrhea, and photosensitivity reaction.</paragraph>

Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, ESBRIET should be used during pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the risk to the patient.</paragraph>

In the presence of maternal toxicity, acyclic/irregular cycles (e.g., prolonged estrous cycle) were seen in rats at doses approximately equal to and higher than the MRDD in adults (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at maternal doses of 450 mg/kg/day and higher).  In a pre- and post-natal development study, prolongation of the gestation period, decreased numbers of live newborn, and reduced pup viability and body weights were seen in rats at an oral dosage approximately 3 times the MRDD in adults (on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at a maternal dose of 1000 mg/kg/day).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effect of ESBRIET on QT interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo, and positive controlled parallel study in 160 healthy adult volunteers.  Volunteers received ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (recommended dose) and 4005 mg/day (1.6 times recommended dose) or placebo for 10 days or a single dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin (active control). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Relative to placebo, the maximum mean change from baseline in study-specific QT interval was 3.2 milliseconds (ms) and 2.2 ms for ESBRIET 2403 mg/day and 4005 mg/day, respectively.  No volunteer had a QTc interval greater than 480 ms or change from baseline greater than 60 ms.  Although there was no evidence that ESBRIET prolonged the QTc interval in this study, a definitive conclusion may not be drawn as the positive control (moxifloxacin) did not perform as expected in this study, and ESBRIET at 4005 mg/day (1.7 times the maximum recommended dose) did not cover the maximum pirfenidone exposure increase with co-administration of fluvoxamine, a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>ESBRIET binds to human plasma proteins, primarily to serum albumin, in a concentration-independent manner over the range of concentrations observed in clinical trials.  The overall mean binding was 58% at concentrations observed in clinical studies (1 to 10 Âµg/mL).  Mean apparent oral volume of distribution is approximately 59 to 71 liters.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> profiling studies in hepatocytes and liver microsomes have shown that ESBRIET is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP1A2 and multiple other CYPs (CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1).  Oral administration of ESBRIET results in the formation of four metabolites.  In humans, only pirfenidone and 5-carboxy-pirfenidone are present in plasma in significant quantities.  The mean metabolite-to-parent ratio ranged from approximately 0.6 to 0.7.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No formal radiolabeled studies have assessed the metabolism of pirfenidone in humans.  <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> data suggests that metabolites are not expected to be pharmacologically active at observed metabolite concentrations.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The mean terminal half-life is approximately 3 hours in healthy subjects.  Pirfenidone is excreted predominantly as metabolite 5-carboxy-pirfenidone, mainly in the urine (approximately 80% of the dose).  The majority of ESBRIET was excreted as the 5-carboxy metabolite (approximately 99.6% of that recovered).</paragraph>

									The pharmacokinetics of ESBRIET and the 5-carboxy-pirfenidone metabolite were studied in 12 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class B) and in 12 subjects with normal hepatic function.  Results showed that the mean exposure, AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> of pirfenidone increased approximately 1.6- and approximately 1.4-fold in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, respectively.

									The pharmacokinetics of pirfenidone and the 5-carboxy-pirfenidone metabolite were studied in 18 subjects with mild (CL<sub>cr</sub> 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (CL<sub>cr</sub> 30 to 50 mL/min), and severe (CL<sub>cr</sub> less than 30 mL/min) renal impairment (n=6/group) and in 6 subjects with normal CL<sub>cr</sub> (greater than or equal to 80 mL/min) renal function.  Results showed that systemic exposure (AUC<sub>0-inf</sub>) to pirfenidone increased approximately 1.4, 1.5, and 1.2-fold in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. The corresponding AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> of 5-carboxy-pirfenidone increased 1.7, 3.4, and 5.6-fold, although the change in the patients with mild renal impairment was not statistically significant.  The renal clearance of 5-carboxy-pirfenidone decreased significantly in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>The efficacy of ESBRIET was evaluated in patients with IPF in three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Study 1 was a 52-week trial comparing ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n=278) versus placebo (n=277) in patients with IPF.  Study 2 and Study 3 were nearly identical to each other in design, with few exceptions, including an intermediate dose treatment arm in Study 2.  Study 2 compared treatment with either ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n=174) or ESBRIET 1197 mg/day (n=87) to placebo (n=174), while Study 3 compared ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n=171) to placebo (n=173).  Study drug was administered three times daily with food for a minimum of 72 weeks.  Patients continued on treatment until the last patient completed 72 weeks of treatment, which included observations to approximately 120 weeks of study treatment.  The primary endpoint was the change in percent predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) from baseline to study end, measured at 52 weeks in Study 1, and at 72 weeks in Studies 2 and 3.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Studies 1, 2 and 3 enrolled adult patients who had a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of IPF (with or without accompanying surgical lung biopsy), without evidence or suspicion of an alternative diagnosis for interstitial lung disease.  Eligible patients were to have %FVC greater than or equal to 50% at baseline and a percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (%DL<sub>CO</sub>) greater than or equal to 30% (Study 1) or 35% (Studies 2 and 3) at baseline.  In all three trials, over 80% of patients completed study treatment.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A total of 1247 patients with IPF were randomized to receive ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n=623) or placebo (n=624) in these three trials.  Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups.  The study population ranged from 40 to 80 years of age (mean age 67 years).  Most patients were male (74%), white (95%), and current or former smokers (65%).  Approximately 93% of patients met criteria for definite IPF on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT).  Baseline mean %FVC and %DL<sub>CO</sub> were 72% and 46%, respectively.  Approximately 15% subjects discontinued from each treatment group.</paragraph>

                     <br/>
						In Study 1, the primary efficacy analysis for the change in %FVC from baseline to Week 52 demonstrated a statistically significant treatment effect of ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n=278) compared with placebo (n=277) using a rank ANCOVA with the lowest rank imputation for missing data due to death.  In Study 2, there was a statistically significant difference at Week 72 for the change in %FVC from baseline.  In Study 3, there was no statistically significant difference at Week 72 for the change in %FVC from baseline. </paragraph>
