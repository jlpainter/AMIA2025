                  <paragraph>IBU tablets contain ibuprofen which possesses analgesic andantipyretic activities. Its mode of action, like that of other NSAIDs, isnot completely understood, but may be related to prostaglandin synthetaseinhibition.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis andosteoarthritis, Ibuprofen tablets have been shown to be comparableto aspirin in controlling pain and inflammation and to be associatedwith a statistically significant reduction in the milder gastrointestinalside effects (see 
       
 
  <content styleCode="bold">
                        <linkHtml href="#_4928ac09-3e61-6f5b-e90a-2391436cc932">ADVERSE REACTIONS</linkHtml>
                     </content>). Ibuprofen may be well toleratedin some patients who have had gastrointestinal side effectswith aspirin, but these patients when treated with IBU tablets shouldbe carefully followed for signs and symptoms of gastrointestinalulceration and bleeding. Although it is not definitely known whetheribuprofen causes less peptic ulceration than aspirin, in one studyinvolving 885 patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated for up to oneyear, there were no reports of gastric ulceration with ibuprofenwhereas frank ulceration was reported in 13 patients in the aspiringroup (statistically significant p&lt;.001).
      

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Gastroscopic studies at varying doses show an increased tendencytoward gastric irritation at higher doses. However, at comparabledoses, gastric irritation is approximately half that seen with aspirin.Studies using 51Cr-tagged red cells indicate that fecal blood lossassociated with Ibuprofen tablets in doses up to 2400 mg daily didnot exceed the normal range, and was significantly less than thatseen in aspirin-treated patients.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In clinical studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Ibuprofenhas been shown to be comparable to indomethacin in controlling thesigns and symptoms of disease activity and to be associated with astatistically significant reduction of the milder gastrointestinal (see

                     </content>) and CNS side effects.
      

 </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Ibuprofen may be used in combination with gold salts and/or corticosteroids.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Controlled studies have demonstrated that Ibuprofen is a more effective analgesic than propoxyphene for the relief of episiotomy pain, pain following dental extraction procedures, and for the relief ofthe symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In patients with primary dysmenorrhea, Ibuprofen has been shown to reduce elevated levels of prostaglandin activity in the menstrualfluid and to reduce resting and active intrauterine pressure, as well asthe frequency of uterine contractions. The probable mechanism ofaction is to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis rather than simply to provide analgesia.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Pharmacodynamics</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In a healthy volunteer study, ibuprofen 400 mg given once daily, administered 2 hours prior to immediate-release aspirin (81 mg) for 6 days, showed an interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin as measured by % serum thromboxane 82 (Tx82) inhibition at 24 hours following the day-6 aspirin dose [53%]. An interaction was still observed, but minimized, when ibuprofen 400 mg given once-daily was administered as early as 8 hours prior to the immediate-release aspirin dose [90.7%]. However, there was no interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin when ibuprofen 400 mg, given once daily, was administered 2 hours after (but not concomitantly, 15 min, or 30 min after) the immediate-release aspirin dose [99.2%].</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In another study, where immediate-release aspirin 81 mg was administered once daily with ibuprofen 400 mg given three times daily (1, 7, and 13 hours post-aspirin dose) for 10 consecutive days, the mean % serum thromboxane 82 (Tx82) inhibition suggested no interaction with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin [98.3%]. However, there were individual subjects with serum Tx82 inhibition below 95%, with the lowest being 90.2%.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Pharmacokinetics</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The ibuprofen in IBU tablets is rapidly absorbed. Peak serum ibuprofen levels are generally attained one to two hours after administration.With single doses up to 800 mg, a linear relationship exists between amount of drug administered and the integrated area underthe serum drug concentration vs time curve. Above 800 mg, however,the area under the curve increases less than proportional to increases in dose. There is no evidence of drug accumulation or enzyme induction.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The administration of Ibuprofen tablets either under fasting conditions or immediately before meals yields quite similar serum ibuprofen concentration-time profiles. When Ibuprofen is administered immediately after a meal, there is a reduction in the rate of absorption but no appreciable decrease in the extent of absorption.The bioavailability of the drug is minimally altered by the presence of food.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>A bioavailability study has shown that there was no interference with the absorption of ibuprofen when given in conjunction with anantacid containing both aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Ibuprofen is rapidly metabolized and eliminated in the urine. The excretion of ibuprofen is virtually complete 24 hours after the last dose. The serum half-life is 1.8 to 2.0 hours.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Studies have shown that following ingestion of the drug, 45% to79% of the dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours as metabolite A (25%), (+)-2-[

                              <paragraph>Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (CV) thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs.The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events, throughout the entire treatment course, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as ibuprofen, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events (see

In a Danish National Registry study of patients with heart failure, NSAID use increased the risk of MI, hospitalization for heart failure, and death.  Additionally, fluid retention and edema have been observed in some patients treated with NSAIDs.

Avoid the use of IBU tablets in patients with severe heart failure unless the benefits are expected to outweigh the risk of worsening heart failure. If IBU tablets is used in patients with severe heart failure, monitor patients for signs of worsening heart failure.

                              <paragraph>NSAIDs, including IBU tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal(GI) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Only one in five patients, who develop a serious upper GI adverse event on NSAID therapy, is symptomatic. Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patientstreated for 3-6 months, and in about 2-4% of patients treated for oneyear. These trends continue with longer duration of use, increasing the likelihood of developing a serious GI event at some time during the course of therapy. However, even short-term therapy is not without risk. NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in thosewith a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding.Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed compared to patients treatedwith neither of these risk factors. Other factors that increase the riskof GI bleeding in patients treated with NSAIDs include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of NSAID therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status. Most spontaneous reports of fatal GI events are in elderly or debilitated patients and therefore, special care should be taken in treating this population. To minimize the potential risk for an adverse GI event in patients treated with an NSAID, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration. Patients and physicians should remain alert for signs and symptoms of GIulcerations and bleeding during NSAID therapy and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a serious GI event is suspected.This should include discontinuation of the NSAID until a serious GI adverse event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Long-term administration of NSAIDs has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Renal toxicity has also been seen in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion. In these patients, administration of a NSAID may cause a dose dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation. Patients at greatest riskof this reaction are those with impaired renal function, heart failure,liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and ACE inhibitors, and the elderly. Discontinuation of NSAID therapy is usually followed by recovery to the pretreatment state.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Pharmacodynamic studies have demonstrated interference with the antiplatelet activity of aspirin when ibuprofen 400 mg, given three times daily, is administered with enteric­ coated low-dose aspirin. The interaction exists even following a once-daily regimen of ibuprofen 400 mg, particularly when ibuprofen is dosed prior to aspirin. The interaction is alleviated if immediate-release low-dose aspirin is dosed at least 2 hours prior to a once­ daily regimen of ibuprofen; however, this finding cannot be extended to enteric-coated low-dose aspirin [see

 </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Because there may be an increased risk of cardiovascular events due to the interference of ibuprofen with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin, for patients taking low-dose aspirin for cardio protection who require analgesics, consider use of an NSAID that does not interfere with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin, or non-NSAID analgesics, where appropriate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When IBU tablets are administered with aspirin, its protein bindingis reduced, although the clearance of free IBU tablets is notaltered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however,as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of ibuprofenand aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential forincreased adverse effects.</paragraph>

Thus, when ibuprofen and lithium are administeredconcurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signsof lithium toxicity.

However, because bleeding has been reported whenIBU tablets and other NSAIDs have been administered to patients oncoumarin-type anticoagulants, the physician should be cautiouswhen administering IBU tablets to patients on anticoagulants. Theeffects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, suchthat the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleedinghigher than users of either drug alone.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Adverse reactions observed during controlled clinical trials at anincidence greater than 1% are listed in the table.

                  <paragraph>Still other reactions occurring less frequently than 1 in 100 werereported in controlled clinical trials and from marketing experience.These reactions have been divided into two categories: Column twoof the table lists reactions with therapy with Ibuprofen tablets wherethe probability of a causal relationship exists: for the reactions inColumn three, a causal relationship with Ibuprofen tablets has notbeen established.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Reported side effects were higher at doses of 3200 mg/day thanat doses of 2400 mg or less per day in clinical trials of patients withrheumatoid arthritis. The increases in incidence were slight and stillwithin the ranges reported in the table.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>Approximately 11⁄2 hours after the reported ingestion of from 7 to10 Ibuprofen tablets (400 mg), a 19-month old child weighing 12 kgwas seen in the hospital emergency room, apneic and cyanotic,responding only to painful stimuli. This type of stimulus, however,was sufficient to induce respiration. Oxygen and parenteral fluidswere given; a greenish-yellow fluid was aspirated from the stomachwith no evidence to indicate the presence of ibuprofen. Two hoursafter ingestion the child’s condition seemed stable; she still respondedonly to painful stimuli and continued to have periods of apnea lastingfrom 5 to 10 seconds. She was admitted to intensive care andsodium bicarbonate was administered as well as infusions of dextroseand normal saline. By four hours post-ingestion she could bearoused easily, sit by herself and respond to spoken commands.Blood level of ibuprofen was 102.9 μg/mL approximately 81⁄2 hoursafter accidental ingestion. At 12 hours she appeared to be completelyrecovered.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In two other reported cases where children (each weighingapproximately 10 kg) accidentally, acutely ingested approximately120 mg/kg, there were no signs of acute intoxication or late sequelae.Blood level in one child 90 minutes after ingestion was 700 μg/mL —about 10 times the peak levels seen in absorption-excretion studies.A 19-year old male who had taken 8,000 mg of ibuprofen over aperiod of a few hours complained of dizziness, and nystagmus wasnoted. After hospitalization, parenteral hydration and three days bedrest, he recovered with no reported sequelae.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>In cases of acute overdosage, the stomach should be emptied byvomiting or lavage, though little drug will likely be recovered if morethan an hour has elapsed since ingestion. Because the drug is acidicand is excreted in the urine, it is theoretically beneficial to administeralkali and induce diuresis. In addition to supportive measures, the useof oral activated charcoal may help to reduce the absorption andreabsorption of Ibuprofen tablets.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Suggested Dosage: 1200 mg-3200 mg daily (400 mg, 600 mg or800 mg tid or qid). Individual patients may show a better responseto 3200 mg daily, as compared with 2400 mg, although in well-controlledclinical trials patients on 3200 mg did not show a better meanresponse in terms of efficacy. Therefore, when treating patients with3200 mg/day, the physician should observe sufficient increased clinicalbenefits to offset potential increased risk.The dose should be tailored to each patient, and may be loweredor raised depending on the severity of symptoms either at time of initiatingdrug therapy or as the patient responds or fails to respond.In general, patients with rheumatoid arthritis seem to require higherdoses of IBU tablets than do patients with osteoarthritis.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The smallest dose of IBU tablets that yields acceptable controlshould be employed. A linear blood level dose-response relationshipexists with single doses up to 800 mg (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGYfor effects of food on rate of absorption).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The availability of three tablet strengths facilitates dosage adjustment.In chronic conditions, a therapeutic response to therapy with IBU tablets is sometimes seen in a few days to a week but most often isobserved by two weeks. After a satisfactory response has beenachieved, the patient’s dose should be reviewed and adjusted asrequired.</paragraph>
