                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Quinine sulfate may cause unpredictable serious and life-threatening hematologic reactions including thrombocytopenia and hemolytic-uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HUS/TTP) in addition to hypersensitivity reactions, QT prolongation, serious cardiac arrhythmias including torsades de pointes, and other serious adverse events requiring medical intervention and hospitalization. Chronic renal impairment associated with the development of TTP, and fatalities have also been reported. The risk associated with the use of quinine sulfate in the absence of evidence of its effectiveness for treatment or prevention of nocturnal leg cramps, outweighs any potential benefit in treating and/or preventing this benign, self-limiting condition [<content styleCode="italics">see <linkHtml href="#LINK_fc440593-edf4-44eb-896e-581567aefbc1">Boxed Warning</linkHtml> and Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#LINK_3d9a0a89-48ba-4040-9c27-6c067b55edbf">4</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Quinine-induced thrombocytopenia is an immune-mediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported, including cases of HUS/TTP. Chronic renal impairment associated with the development of TTP has also been reported. Thrombocytopenia usually resolves within a week upon discontinuation of quinine. If quinine is not stopped, a patient is at risk for fatal hemorrhage. Upon re-exposure to quinine from any source, a patient with quinine-dependent antibodies could develop thrombocytopenia that is more rapid in onset and more severe than the original episode.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.4 QT Prolongation and Ventricular Arrhythmias</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>QT interval prolongation has been a consistent finding in studies which evaluated electrocardiographic changes with oral or parenteral quinine administration, regardless of age, clinical status, or severity of disease. The maximum increase in QT interval has been shown to correspond with peak quinine plasma concentration [<content styleCode="italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#LINK_8e3b9427-c087-414c-b493-5ea355a05fa8">12.2</linkHtml>)</content>]. Quinine sulfate has been rarely associated with potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, and ventricular fibrillation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Quinine sulfate has been shown to cause concentration-dependent prolongation of the PR and QRS interval. At particular risk are patients with underlying structural heart disease and preexisting conduction system abnormalities, elderly patients with sick sinus syndrome, patients with atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, patients with myocardial ischemia or patients receiving drugs known to prolong the PR interval (e.g., verapamil) or QRS interval (e.g., flecainide or quinidine) [<content styleCode="italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#LINK_8e3b9427-c087-414c-b493-5ea355a05fa8">12.2</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Quinine sulfate is not recommended for use with other drugs known to cause QT prolongation, including Class IA antiarrhythmic agents (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide), and Class III antiarrhythmic agents (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The use of macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin should be avoided in patients receiving quinine sulfate. Fatal torsades de pointes was reported in an elderly patient who received concomitant quinine, erythromycin, and dopamine. Although a causal relationship between a specific drug and the arrhythmia was not established in this case, erythromycin is a CYP3A4 inhibitor and has been shown to increase quinine plasma levels when used concomitantly. A related macrolide antibiotic, troleandomycin, has also been shown to increase quinine exposure in a pharmacokinetic study [<content styleCode="italics">see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_44fc0537-5954-47c8-819d-639266ec315a">7</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Quinine may inhibit the metabolism of certain drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates and are known to cause QT prolongation, e.g., astemizole, cisapride, terfenadine, pimozide, halofantrine and quinidine. Torsades de pointes has been reported in patients who received concomitant quinine and astemizole. Therefore, concurrent use of quinine sulfate with these medications, or drugs with similar properties, should be avoided [<content styleCode="italics">see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_44fc0537-5954-47c8-819d-639266ec315a">7</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Concomitant administration of quinine sulfate with the antimalarial drugs, mefloquine or halofantrine, may result in electrocardiographic abnormalities, including QT prolongation, and increase the risk for torsades de pointes or other serious ventricular arrhythmias. Concurrent use of quinine sulfate and mefloquine may also increase the risk of seizures [<content styleCode="italics">see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_44fc0537-5954-47c8-819d-639266ec315a">7</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Quinine sulfate should also be avoided in patients with known prolongation of QT interval and in patients with clinical conditions known to prolong the QT interval, such as uncorrected hypokalemia, bradycardia, and certain cardiac conditions [<content styleCode="italics">see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#LINK_3d9a0a89-48ba-4040-9c27-6c067b55edbf">4</linkHtml>)</content>].</paragraph>

                           </content>Quinine crosses the placenta with measurable blood concentrations in the fetus. In 8 women who delivered live infants 1 to 6 days after starting quinine therapy, umbilical cord plasma quinine concentrations were between 1.0 and 4.6 mg/L (mean 2.4 mg/L) and the mean (±SD) ratio of cord plasma to maternal plasma quinine concentrations was 0.32 ± 0.14. Quinine levels in the fetus may not be therapeutic.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Adverse outcomes have been identified in the post-marketing experience with quinine during pregnancy. Because these outcomes are reported from varied data sources and have inconsistent findings and/or important methodological limitations, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. </paragraph>

The overall rate of congenital malformations (9 of 633 offspring [1.4%]) was not different for women who were treated with quinine sulfate compared with the control group (38 of 2201 offspring [1.7%]). The spontaneous abortion rate was higher in the control group (10.9%) than in women treated with quinine sulfate (3.5%) [OR = 3.1; 95% CI 2.1 to 4.7]. An epidemiologic survey that included 104 mother-child pairs exposed to quinine during the first 4 months of pregnancy, found no increased risk of structural birth defects was seen (2 fetal malformations [1.9%]).

Increases in fetal death were observed in utero in pregnant rabbits at maternal doses ≥ 100 mg/kg/day and in pregnant dogs at ≥ 15 mg/kg/day corresponding to dose levels approximately 0.5 and 0.25 times the MRHD respectively based on BSA comparisons. Rabbit offspring had increased rates of degenerated auditory nerve and spiral ganglion and increased rates of CNS anomalies such as anencephaly and microcephaly at a dose of 130 mg/kg/day corresponding to a maternal dose approximately 1.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. Guinea pig offspring had increased rates of cochlear hemorrhage at maternal doses of 200 mg/kg corresponding to a dose level of approximately 1.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison. No fetal malformations were observed in rats at maternal doses up to 300 mg/kg/day and in monkeys at maternal doses up to 200 mg/kg/day corresponding to doses approximately 1 and 2 times the MRHD respectively based on BSA comparisons.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a pre-postnatal study, pregnant rats received quinine sulfate in feed beginning two weeks prior to mating, through gestation, and lactation. An estimated oral dose of quinine sulfate of 20 mg/kg/day corresponding to approximately 0.1 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison resulted in offspring with impaired growth, lower body weights at birth and during the lactation period, and delayed physical development of teeth eruption and eye opening during the lactation period.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), quinine oral clearance (CL/F) is decreased, volume of distribution (Vd/F) is increased, and half-life is prolonged, relative to subjects with normal liver function. Therefore, quinine is not indicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment and alternate therapy should be administered [<content styleCode="italics">see Dosage and Administration (<linkHtml href="#LINK_0cccd1c5-e682-401f-9ca3-3224a6e62d1a">2.3</linkHtml>) and Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#LINK_b77a25b4-3e2a-471a-9ca8-20cd715cc7ac">12.3</linkHtml>)</content>]. </paragraph>

               <title>10 OVERDOSAGE</title>
               <text>
                  <paragraph>Quinine overdose can be associated with serious complications, including visual impairment, hypoglycemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and death. Visual impairment can range from blurred vision and defective color perception, to visual field constriction and permanent blindness. Cinchonism occurs in virtually all patients with quinine overdose. Symptoms range from headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, tinnitus, vertigo, hearing impairment, sweating, flushing, and blurred vision, to deafness, blindness, serious cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and circulatory collapse. Central nervous system toxicity (drowsiness, disturbances of consciousness, ataxia, convulsions, respiratory depression, and coma) has also been reported with quinine overdose, as well as pulmonary edema and adult respiratory distress syndrome. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Most toxic reactions are dose-related; however, some reactions may be idiosyncratic because of the variable sensitivity of patients to the toxic effects of quinine. A lethal dose of quinine has not been clearly defined, but fatalities have been reported after the ingestion of 2 to 8 grams in adults.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Quinine, like quinidine, has Class I antiarrhythmic properties. The cardiotoxicity of quinine is due to its negative inotropic action, and to its effect on cardiac conduction, resulting in decreased rates of depolarization and conduction, and increased action potential and effective refractory period. ECG changes observed with quinine overdose include sinus tachycardia, PR prolongation, T wave inversion, bundle branch block, an increased QT interval, and a widening of the QRS complex. Quinine’s alpha-blocking properties may result in hypotension and further exacerbate myocardial depression by decreasing coronary perfusion. Quinine overdose has been also associated with hypotension, cardiogenic shock, and circulatory collapse, ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, idioventricular rhythm, and torsades de pointes, as well as bradycardia, and atrioventricular block [<content styleCode="italics">see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#LINK_daf415b4-c222-4da8-b023-71dce949df4a">5</linkHtml>) and Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#LINK_b77a25b4-3e2a-471a-9ca8-20cd715cc7ac">12.3</linkHtml>)</content>]. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Quinine is rapidly absorbed, and attempts to remove residual quinine sulfate from the stomach by gastric lavage may not be effective. Multiple-dose activated charcoal has been shown to decrease plasma quinine concentrations [<content styleCode="italics">see Clinical Pharmacology (<linkHtml href="#LINK_b77a25b4-3e2a-471a-9ca8-20cd715cc7ac">12.3</linkHtml>)</content>]. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Forced acid diuresis, hemodialysis, charcoal column hemoperfusion, and plasma exchange were not found to be effective in significantly increasing quinine elimination in a series of 16 patients. </paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Quinine has been used worldwide for hundreds of years in the treatment of malaria. Thorough searches of the published literature identified over 1300 references to the treatment of malaria with quinine, and from these, 21 randomized, active-controlled studies were identified which evaluated oral quinine monotherapy or combination therapy for treatment of uncomplicated <content styleCode="italics">P. falciparum </content>malaria. Over 2900 patients from malaria-endemic areas were enrolled in these studies, and more than 1400 patients received oral quinine. </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>The following conclusions were drawn from review of these studies:</paragraph>

                     <item>In areas where multi-drug resistance of the parasite was not as widespread, cure rates with 7 days of quinine monotherapy ranged from 86 to 100%. </item>

                  <paragraph>Completion of a 7 day oral quinine treatment regimen may be limited by drug intolerance, and shorter courses (3 days) of quinine combination therapy have been used. However, the published data from randomized, controlled clinical trials for shorter regimens of oral quinine in conjunction with tetracycline, doxycycline, or clindamycin for treatment of uncomplicated <content styleCode="italics">P. falciparum</content> malaria is limited, and these shorter course combination regimens may not be as effective as the longer regimens.</paragraph>
