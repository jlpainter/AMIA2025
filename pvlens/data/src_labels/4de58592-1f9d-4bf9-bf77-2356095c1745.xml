To prime BEVESPI AEROSPHERE, release 4 sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well before each spray. BEVESPI AEROSPHERE must be re-primed when the inhaler has not been used for more than 7 days. To re-prime BEVESPI AEROSPHERE, release 2 sprays into the air away from the face, shaking well before each spray.</paragraph>

                     <title>5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes</title>
                     <text>
                        <paragraph>BEVESPI AEROSPHERE should not be initiated in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD, which may be a life-threatening condition. BEVESPI AEROSPHERE has not been studied in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD. The use of BEVESPI AEROSPHERE in this setting is inappropriate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>BEVESPI AEROSPHERE should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. BEVESPI AEROSPHERE has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>When beginning BEVESPI AEROSPHERE, patients who have been taking inhaled, short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., four times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these medicines and use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing BEVESPI AEROSPHERE, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used. Increasing inhaled beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist use is a signal of deteriorating disease for which prompt medical attention is indicated.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If BEVESPI AEROSPHERE no longer controls the symptoms of bronchoconstriction, or the patient’s inhaled, short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist becomes less effective, or the patient needs more inhalations of short-acting beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting, a re-evaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dosage of BEVESPI AEROSPHERE beyond the recommended dose is not appropriate in this situation.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Formoterol fumarate, like other beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by increases in pulse rate, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, or symptoms <content styleCode="italics">[see <linkHtml href="#_12_2_Pharmacodynamics">Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)</linkHtml>]</content>. If such effects occur, BEVESPI AEROSPHERE may need to be discontinued. In addition, beta-agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiographic changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression, although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Therefore, BEVESPI AEROSPHERE should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The clinical program for BEVESPI AEROSPHERE included 4,911 subjects with COPD in two 24-week lung function trials, one long-term safety extension study of 28 weeks, and 10 other trials of shorter duration. A total of 1,302 subjects have received at least 1 dose of BEVESPI AEROSPHERE. The safety data described below are based on the two 24-week trials and the one 28-week long-term safety extension trial. Adverse reactions observed in the other trials were similar to those observed in these confirmatory trials.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The incidence of adverse reactions with BEVESPI AEROSPHERE in Table 1 is based on reports in two 24-week, placebo-controlled trials (Trials 1 and 2; n=2,100 and n=1,610, respectively). Of the 3,710 subjects, 56% were male and 91% were Caucasian. They had a mean age of 63 years and an average smoking history of 51 pack-years, with 54% identified as current smokers. At screening, the mean post-bronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) was 51% (range: 19% to 82%) and the mean percent reversibility was 20% (range: -32% to 135%).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist is exceeded. Approximately 17% of subjects were taking non-potassium sparing diuretics during the two 24-week placebo-controlled trials in subjects with COPD. The incidence of adverse events in subjects taking non-potassium-sparing diuretics was similar between BEVESPI AEROSPHERE and placebo treatment groups. In addition, there was no evidence of a treatment effect on serum potassium with BEVESPI AEROSPHERE compared to placebo in subjects taking non-potassium sparing diuretics during the two 24-week trials. However, caution is advised in the coadministration of BEVESPI AEROSPHERE with non-potassium-sparing diuretics.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and BEVESPI AEROSPHERE may interfere with the effect of each other when administered concurrently. Beta-blockers not only block the therapeutic effects of beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists, but may produce severe bronchospasm in COPD patients. Therefore, patients with COPD should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-blockers in patients with COPD. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of BEVESPI AEROSPHERE or its individual components, glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate, in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In animal reproduction studies, glycopyrrolate alone, administered by the subcutaneous route in rats and rabbits, did not cause structural abnormalities or affect fetal survival at exposures approximately 2700 and 5400 times from the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID), respectively. Glycopyrrolate had no effects on the physical, functional, and behavioral development of rat pups with exposures up to 2700 times the MRHDID.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Formoterol fumarate alone, administered by the oral route in rats and rabbits, caused structural abnormalities at 1500 and 61,000 times the MRHDID, respectively. Formoterol fumarate was also embryocidal, increased pup loss at birth and during lactation, and decreased pup weight in rats at 110 times the MRHDID. These adverse effects generally occurred at large multiples of the MRHDID when formoterol fumarate was administered by the oral route to achieve high systemic exposures. No structural abnormalities, embryocidal, or developmental effects were seen in rats that received inhalation doses up to 350 times the MRHDID.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>In a fertility and reproduction study, male rats were orally dosed for at least 9 weeks and females for 2 weeks prior to pairing and throughout the mating period. Females were either dosed up to gestation day 19 or up until weaning of their offspring. Males were dosed up to 25 weeks. Umbilical hernia was observed in rat fetuses at oral doses 1500 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at maternal oral doses of 3000 mcg/kg/day and higher). Brachygnathia was observed in rat fetuses at a dose 8000 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at a maternal oral dose of 15,000 mcg/kg/day). Pregnancy was prolonged at a dose 8000 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at a maternal oral dose of 15,000 mcg/kg/day). Fetal and pup deaths occurred at doses approximately 1500 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at oral doses of 3000 mcg/kg/day and higher) during gestation.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis, no structural abnormalities, embryocidal effects, or developmental effects were seen at doses up to 350 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis with maternal inhalation doses up to 690 mcg/kg/day).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18, subcapsular cysts on the liver were observed in the fetuses at a dose 61,000 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis with a maternal oral dose of 60,000 mcg/kg/day). No teratogenic effects were observed at doses up to 3500 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at maternal oral doses up to 3500 mcg/kg/day).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>In a pre- and post-natal development study, pregnant female rats received formoterol at oral doses of 0, 210, 840, and 3400 mcg/kg/day from gestation day 6 (completion of implantation) through the lactation period. Pup survival was decreased from birth to postpartum day 26 at doses 110 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mcg/m<sup>2</sup> basis at maternal oral doses of 210 mcg/kg/day and higher), although there was no evidence of a dose-response relationship. There were no treatment-related effects on the physical, functional, and behavioral development of rat pups.</paragraph>

               <text>
                  <paragraph>No cases of overdose have been reported with BEVESPI AEROSPHERE. BEVESPI AEROSPHERE contains both glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to BEVESPI AEROSPHERE. Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of BEVESPI AEROSPHERE together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered, bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm. Cardiac monitoring is recommended in case of overdosage.</paragraph>

                  </paragraph>
                  <paragraph>An overdose of formoterol fumarate would likely lead to an exaggeration of effects that are typical for beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists: seizures, angina, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, nervousness, headache, tremor, palpitations, muscle cramps, nausea, dizziness, sleep disturbances, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia. As with all sympathomimetic medications, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with overdosage of formoterol fumarate.</paragraph>

                  <paragraph>Formoterol fumarate contains two chiral centers (denoted by * in structure above), and consists of a single enantiomeric pair (a racemate of R,R and S,S).</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>BEVESPI AEROSPHERE is formulated as a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA 134a) propelled pressurized metered dose inhaler containing 120 inhalations. The canister has an attached dose indicator and is supplied with a white plastic actuator body and mouthpiece with an orange dust cap.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>After priming each actuation of the inhaler meters 10.4 mcg of glycopyrrolate (equivalent to 8.3 mcg of glycopyrronium) and 5.5 mcg of formoterol fumarate from the valve which delivers 9 mcg of glycopyrrolate (equivalent to 7.2 mcg of glycopyrronium) and 4.8 mcg of formoterol fumarate from the actuator. The actual amount of drug delivered to the lung may depend on patient factors, such as the coordination between actuation of the device and inspiration through the delivery system. BEVESPI AEROSPHERE also contains porous particles that form a cosuspension with the drug crystals. The porous particles are comprised of the phospholipid, 1,2-Distearoyl-<content styleCode="italics">sn</content>-glycero-3-phosphocholine<content styleCode="italics"> </content>(DSPC), and calcium chloride.

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>BEVESPI AEROSPHERE contains both glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate. The mechanism of action described below for the individual components applies to BEVESPI AEROSPHERE. These drugs represent two different classes of medications (an anticholinergic, and a long-acting selective beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist) that have different effects on clinical physiology and inflammatory indices of COPD.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Glycopyrrolate</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Glycopyrrolate is a long-acting antimuscarinic agent which is often referred to as an anticholinergic. It has similar affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, it exhibits pharmacological effects through inhibition of the M3 receptor at the smooth muscle leading to bronchodilation. The competitive and reversible nature of antagonism was shown with human and animal origin receptors and isolated organ preparations. In preclinical <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> as well as <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> studies, prevention of methylcholine and acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstrictive effects was dose-dependent and lasted more than 12 hours. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The bronchodilation following inhalation of glycopyrrolate is predominantly a site-specific effect.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>
                           <content styleCode="underline">Formoterol Fumarate</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting selective beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist (beta<sub>2</sub>-agonist) with a rapid onset of action. Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. <content styleCode="italics">In vitro</content> studies have shown that formoterol has more than 200-fold greater agonist activity at beta<sub>2</sub>-receptors than at beta<sub>1</sub>-receptors. The <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content> binding selectivity to beta<sub>2</sub>- over beta<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors is higher for formoterol than for albuterol (5 times), whereas salmeterol has a higher (3 times) beta<sub>2</sub>-selectivity ratio than formoterol.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Although beta<sub>2</sub>-receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta<sub>1</sub>-receptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta<sub>2</sub>-receptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenergic receptors. The precise function of these receptors has not been established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective beta<sub>2</sub>-agonists may have cardiac effects.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The pharmacologic effects of beta<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol fumarate, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The potential for QTc interval prolongation was assessed in a double-blind, single-dose, placebo- and positive-controlled crossover trial in 69 healthy subjects. The largest mean (90% upper confidence bound) differences from placebo in baseline-corrected QTcI for 2 inhalations of BEVESPI AEROSPHERE and glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate 72/19.2 mcg, were 3.1 (4.7) ms and 7.6 (9.2) ms, respectively, and excluded the clinically relevant threshold of 10 ms.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A dose-dependent increase in heart rate was also observed. The largest mean (90% upper confidence bound) differences from placebo in baseline-corrected heart rate were 3.3 (4.9) beats/min and 7.6 (9.5) beats/min seen within 10 minutes of dosing with 2 inhalations of BEVESPI AEROSPHERE and glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate 72/19.2 mcg, respectively. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effect of glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate on cardiac rhythm in subjects with COPD was assessed using 24-hour Holter monitoring in 2-week and 24-week trials. All treatments were administered as two inhalations twice daily. In the 2-week trial, the Holter monitoring population included 58 subjects on glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate 18/4.8 mcg, 58 subjects on glycopyrrolate 18 mcg, and 60 subjects on formoterol fumarate 4.8 mcg. In the 24-week trial, the Holter monitoring population included 171 subjects on BEVESPI AEROSPHERE, 160 subjects on glycopyrrolate 9 mcg, 174 subjects on formoterol fumarate 4.8 mcg, and 80 subjects on placebo. No clinically meaningful effects on cardiac rhythm were observed.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Dose selection for BEVESPI AEROSPHERE for COPD was primarily based on data for the individual components, glycopyrrolate and formoterol fumarate, in COPD patients. Based on the findings from these studies, glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate 18/9.6 mcg administered twice-daily was evaluated in the confirmatory COPD trials. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Dose selection for glycopyrrolate was supported by a 14-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, incomplete-block crossover trial evaluating 6 doses of glycopyrrolate (GP MDI 18 to 0.6 mcg) administered twice daily and an open-label active control in 140 subjects with COPD. A dose ordering was observed, with the glycopyrrolate 18 mcg demonstrating larger improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> over 12 hours compared with glycopyrrolate 9, 4.6, 2.4, 1.2, and 0.6 mcg (Figure 1).</paragraph>

Two additional dose ranging trials (single-dose and 7-day trials) in subjects with COPD demonstrated minimal additional benefit at doses above 18 mcg of glycopyrrolate. The results supported the selection of 18 mcg of glycopyrrolate twice daily in the confirmatory COPD trials.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Evaluations of the appropriate dosing interval for glycopyrrolate were conducted by comparing to open-label ipratropium bromide inhalation aerosol administered four times daily. The results supported the selection of a twice-daily dosing interval for further evaluation in the confirmatory COPD trials.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>The clinical development program for BEVESPI AEROSPHERE included two (Trial 1 and Trial 2) 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials in subjects with moderate to very severe COPD designed to evaluate the efficacy of BEVESPI AEROSPHERE on lung function. The 24-week trials included 3,699 subjects that had a clinical diagnosis of COPD, were between 40 and 80 years of age, had a history of smoking greater than or equal to 10 pack-years, had a post-albuterol FEV<sub>1</sub> less than 80% of predicted normal values, and had a ratio of FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC of less than 0.7. The majority of patients were male (56%) and Caucasian (91%) with a mean age of 63 years and an average smoking history of 51 pack-years (54% current smokers). During screening, mean post-bronchodilator percent predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> was 51% (range: 19% to 82%) and mean percent reversibility was 20% (range: -32% to 135%).</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Trial 1 and Trial 2 evaluated BEVESPI AEROSPHERE (glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate) 18 mcg/9.6 mcg, glycopyrrolate 18 mcg, formoterol fumarate 9.6 mcg, and placebo administered twice daily (BID). Trial 1 also included an open-label active control. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> at Week 24 compared with placebo, glycopyrrolate 18 mcg BID, and formoterol fumarate 9.6 mcg BID. The comparison of BEVESPI AEROSPHERE with glycopyrrolate 18 mcg and formoterol fumarate 9.6 mcg was assessed to evaluate the contribution of the individual components to BEVESPI AEROSPHERE. In both trials, BEVESPI AEROSPHERE demonstrated a larger increase in mean change from baseline in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> at Week 24 relative to placebo, glycopyrrolate 18 mcg, and formoterol fumarate 9.6 mcg (Table 2). </paragraph>
