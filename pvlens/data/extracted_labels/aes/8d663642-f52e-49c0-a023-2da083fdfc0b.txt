To control for disparate exposure between arms, Table 3 reports the per patient incidence of adverse reactions that occurred during the first 8 infusions. Adverse reactions that occurred >3% in the SYLVANT arm are presented. The most common adverse reactions (> 10% compared to placebo) during treatment with SYLVANT in the MCD clinical trial were rash, pruritus, upper respiratory tract infection, increased weight, and hyperuricemia.
