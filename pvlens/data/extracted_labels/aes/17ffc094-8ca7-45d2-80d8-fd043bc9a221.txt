Adverse Reactions in HCV-Infected Subjects without Cirrhosis or with Compensated Cirrhosis The adverse reactions data for VOSEVI were derived from two Phase 3 clinical trials (POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4) that evaluated a total of 445 subjects infected with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 HCV, without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A), who received VOSEVI for 12 weeks. VOSEVI was studied in placebo- and active-controlled (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1 and 14.2) ]. The proportion of subjects who permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 0.2% for subjects who received VOSEVI for 12 weeks. The most common adverse reactions (adverse events assessed as causally related by the investigator and at least 10%) were headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea in subjects treated with VOSEVI for 12 weeks. Table 2 lists adverse reactions (adverse events assessed as causally related by the investigator, all grades) observed in at least 5% of subjects receiving 12 weeks of treatment with VOSEVI in the Phase 3 clinical trials. The side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparison across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs.

In POLARIS-4, of the subjects receiving VOSEVI who experienced adverse reactions, all the reported adverse reactions were mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in severity. Less Common Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials The following adverse reactions occurred in less than 5% of subjects without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis treated with VOSEVI for 12 weeks and are included because of a potential causal relationship. Rash: In the POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 trials, rash occurred in less than 1% and 2% of subjects treated with VOSEVI, respectively. Rash was reported in 1% of subjects treated with placebo in POLARIS-1 and was not reported by any subject taking sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in POLARIS-4. No serious adverse reactions of rash occurred, and all rashes were mild or moderate in severity. Depression: In the POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 trials, depressed mood occurred in less than 1% and 1% of subjects treated with VOSEVI, respectively. Depressed mood was not reported by any subject taking placebo in POLARIS-1 and was reported in 1% of subjects treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in POLARIS-4. No serious adverse reactions of depressed mood occurred and all events were mild or moderate in severity. Laboratory Abnormalities Lipase Elevations: Isolated, asymptomatic lipase elevations of greater than 3×ULN were observed in POLARIS-1 in 2% of subjects treated with VOSEVI and 3% of subjects treated with placebo, and in POLARIS-4 in 2% of subjects treated with VOSEVI and less than 1% of subjects treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Creatine Kinase: Isolated, asymptomatic creatine kinase elevations greater than or equal to 10×ULN were reported in POLARIS-1 in 1% of subjects treated with VOSEVI and 1% of subjects treated with placebo, and in POLARIS-4 in less than 1% of subjects treated with VOSEVI and no subjects treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Total bilirubin: Increases in total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5×ULN were observed in subjects treated with VOSEVI due to inhibition of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 by voxilaprevir: 4% and 6% of subjects without cirrhosis in POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4, respectively; and 7% and 13% of subjects with compensated cirrhosis in POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4, respectively. No subjects experienced jaundice and total bilirubin levels decreased after completing VOSEVI treatment. 6.2	Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of sofosbuvir-containing regimens. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatic decompensation, hepatic failure with NS3/4A protease inhibitor-containing regimens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Cardiac Disorders Serious symptomatic bradycardia has been reported in patients taking amiodarone who initiated treatment with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Skin rashes, sometimes with blisters or angioedema-like swelling Angioedema
