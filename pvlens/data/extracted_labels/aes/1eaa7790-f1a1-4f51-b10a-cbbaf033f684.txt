Adult Population During clinical development, 560 patients were exposed to CALDOLOR, 438 in pain and 122 with fever.

The most frequent type of adverse reaction occurring with oral ibuprofen is gastrointestinal. Pain Studies The incidence rates of adverse reactions listed in the following table were derived from multi-center, controlled clinical studies in post-operative patients comparing CALDOLOR to placebo in patients also receiving morphine as needed for post-operative pain.

The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 2%) in pediatric patients treated with CALDOLOR were infusion site pain, vomiting, nausea, anemia and headache. Twenty-one hospitalized patients ages 3 months to less than 6 months were treated with CALDOLOR for pain or fever in an open-label, non-controlled clinical study; 18 of 21 patients were treated with a single dose.
