The incidence of patients discontinuing from Study 1 and Study 2 for any adverse reaction was 5% for XADAGO 50 mg/day, 6% for XADAGO 100 mg/day, and 4% for placebo.

Common Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled PD Studies Table 1 shows the incidence of adverse reactions with an incidence of at least 2% on XADAGO 100 mg/day and greater than placebo in controlled studies in PD (Study 1 and Study 2). The most common adverse reactions associated with XADAGO treatment in which the incidence for XADAGO 100 mg/day was at least 2% greater than the incidence for placebo were dyskinesia, fall, nausea, and insomnia. Adverse Reactions Reported as Reason for Discontinuation from Study In pooled placebo-controlled studies (Study 1 and Study 2) in patients with PD taking a stable dose of carbidopa/levodopa with or without other PD medications, there was an increase in the incidence of XADAGO-treated patients who discontinued from the study because of adverse reactions. The incidence of patients discontinuing from Study 1 and Study 2 for any adverse reaction was 5% for XADAGO 50 mg/day, 6% for XADAGO 100 mg/day, and 4% for placebo. The most frequently reported adverse reaction causing study discontinuation was dyskinesia (1% of patients treated with XADAGO 50 mg/day or XADAGO 100 mg/day vs. 0% for placebo).

The incidence of patients with an increase in AST to at least 3 times the upper limit of normal was similar for XADAGO and placebo. 6.2	Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of safinamide. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity: A postmarketing report describes a patient who developed a hypersensitivity reaction consisting of swelling of the tongue and gingiva, dyspnea and skin rash. The symptoms resolved shortly after XADAGO was discontinued, but reappeared following rechallenge a month later. Nervous System Disorders: Headache
