ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA 325 mg/40 mg was studied primarily in two randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trials (n=524) of 6 months duration. Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in >2% of patients in the ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA arm and were more common than in the control arm, consisting of 325 mg of enteric coated (EC)-aspirin.

The most common reasons for discontinuations due to adverse reactions in the ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA treatment group were upper abdominal pain (<1%, n=2), diarrhea (<1%, n=2) and dyspepsia (<1%, n=2). Less Common Adverse Reactions In ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA-treated patients in the clinical trials there were 2 patients with upper GI bleeding (gastric or duodenal) and 2 patients with lower GI bleeding (hematochezia and large intestinal hemorrhage) and one additional patient experienced obstruction in the small bowel. See also the full prescribing information of aspirin and omeprazole products for additional adverse reactions. 6.2 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of aspirin and omeprazole separately. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Aspirin Body as a Whole: Fever, hypothermia, thirst Cardiovascular: Dysrhythmias, hypotension, tachycardia Central Nervous System: Agitation, cerebral edema, coma, confusion, dizziness, headache, subdural or intracranial hemorrhage, lethargy, seizures Fluid and Electrolyte: Dehydration, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis Gastrointestinal: Dyspepsia, GI bleeding, ulceration and perforation, nausea, vomiting, transient elevations of hepatic enzymes, hepatitis, Reye's Syndrome [see Contraindications (4) ] , pancreatitis Hematologic: Prolongation of the prothrombin time, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity: Acute anaphylaxis, angioedema, asthma, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, urticaria Musculoskeletal: Rhabdomyolysis Metabolism: Hypoglycemia (in pediatrics), hyperglycemia Reproductive: Prolonged pregnancy and labor, stillbirths, lower birth weight infants, antepartum and postpartum bleeding Respiratory: Hyperpnea, pulmonary edema, tachypnea Special Senses: Hearing loss, tinnitus. Patients with high frequency hearing loss may have difficulty perceiving tinnitus. In these patients, tinnitus cannot be used as a clinical indicator of salicylism. Urogenital: Interstitial nephritis, papillary necrosis, proteinuria, renal impairment and failure Omeprazole Body As a Whole: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock, angioedema, bronchospasm [see Contraindications (4) ], interstitial nephritis, urticaria (see also Skin below), systemic lupus erythematosus, fever, pain, fatigue, malaise Cardiovascular: Chest pain or angina, tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations, elevated blood pressure, peripheral edema Endocrine: Gynecomastia Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis (some fatal), anorexia, irritable colon, fecal discoloration, esophageal candidiasis, mucosal atrophy of the tongue, stomatitis, abdominal swelling, dry mouth, microscopic colitis, fundic gland polyps. Gastroduodenal carcinoids have been reported in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome on long-term treatment with omeprazole. This finding is believed to be a manifestation of the underlying condition, which is known to be associated with such tumors.
