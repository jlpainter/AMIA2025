ARISTADA Patient Exposure ARISTADA has been evaluated for safety in 1180 adult patients in clinical trials in schizophrenia. Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reaction (incidence ≥5% and at least twice the rate of placebo in patients treated with ARISTADA) was akathisia. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in ARISTADA-Treated Patients Adverse reactions associated with the use of ARISTADA (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and ARISTADA incidence greater than placebo) that occurred are shown in Table 8 .

Extrapyramidal Symptoms In the 12-week schizophrenia efficacy study [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , for ARISTADA-treated patients, the incidence of other EPS-related events, excluding akathisia and restlessness, was 5% and 7% for patients on 441 mg and 882 mg, respectively, versus 4% for placebo-treated patient ( Table 9 ).
