A total of 6,622 heart failure patients were treated with ENTRESTO in the PARADIGM-HF (vs. enalapril) and PARAGON-HF (vs. valsartan) clinical trials. Of these, 5,085 were exposed for at least 1 year. Adult Heart Failure In PARADIGM-HF, patients were required to complete sequential enalapril and ENTRESTO run-in periods of (median) 15 and 29 days, respectively, prior to entering the randomized double-blind period comparing ENTRESTO and enalapril. During the enalapril run-in period, 1,102 patients (10.5%) were permanently discontinued from the study, 5.6% because of an adverse event, most commonly renal dysfunction (1.7%), hyperkalemia (1.7%) and hypotension (1.4%).

Discontinuation of therapy because of an adverse event during the double-blind period occurred in 450 (10.7%) of ENTRESTO-treated patients and 516 (12.2%) of patients receiving enalapril. Adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of greater than or equal to 5% in patients who were treated with ENTRESTO in the double-blind period of PARADIGM-HF are shown in Table 3. In PARADIGM-HF, the incidence of angioedema was 0.1% in both the enalapril and ENTRESTO run-in periods. In the double-blind period, the incidence of angioedema was higher in patients treated with ENTRESTO than enalapril (0.5% and 0.2%, respectively). The incidence of angioedema in Black patients was 2.4% with ENTRESTO and 0.5% with enalapril [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Orthostasis was reported in 2.1% of patients treated with ENTRESTO compared to 1.1% of patients treated with enalapril during the double-blind period of PARADIGM-HF. Falls were reported in 1.9% of patients treated with ENTRESTO compared to 1.3% of patients treated with enalapril.

Pediatric Heart Failure The adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients 1 year to less than 18 years old who received treatment with ENTRESTO were consistent with those observed in adult patients. Laboratory Abnormalities Hemoglobin and Hematocrit Decreases in hemoglobin/hematocrit of greater than 20% were observed in approximately 5% of both ENTRESTO- and enalapril-treated patients in the double-blind period in PARADIGM-HF. Decreases in hemoglobin/hematocrit of greater than 20% were observed in approximately 7% of ENTRESTO-treated patients and 9% of valsartan-treated patients in the double-blind period in PARAGON-HF. Serum Creatinine During the double-blind period in PARADIGM-HF, approximately 16% of both ENTRESTO- and enalapril-treated patients had increases in serum creatinine of greater than 50%. During the double-blind period in PARAGON-HF, approximately 17% of ENTRESTO-treated patients and 21% of valsartan-treated patients had increases in serum creatinine of greater than 50%. Serum Potassium During the double-blind period of PARADIGM-HF, approximately 16% of both ENTRESTO- and enalapril-treated patients had potassium concentrations greater than 5.5 mEq/L. During the double-blind period of PARAGON-HF, approximately 18% of ENTRESTO-treated patients and 20% of valsartan-treated patients had potassium concentrations greater than 5.5 mEq/L. 6.2     Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in postmarketing experience. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
