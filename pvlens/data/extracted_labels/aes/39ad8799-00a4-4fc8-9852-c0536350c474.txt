Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of ANTHIM Infusion ANTHIM infusion was discontinued in 8/320 healthy subjects (2.5%) in clinical trials due to hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Most Frequently Reported Adverse Reactions The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache, pruritus, infections of the upper respiratory tract, cough, vessel puncture site bruise, infusion site swelling, urticaria, nasal congestion, infusion site pain, and pain in extremity.
