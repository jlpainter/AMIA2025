The safety of ARISTADA INITIO, in combination with oral aripiprazole, for the initiation of ARISTADA when used for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults has been established and is based on clinical trials of ARISTADA (aripiprazole lauroxil) including 1019 adult patients with schizophrenia. Patient Exposure ARISTADA INITIO has been evaluated for safety in 170 adult patients in clinical trials in schizophrenia. In pharmacokinetic studies, the safety profile of ARISTADA INITIO was generally consistent with that observed for ARISTADA. ARISTADA (Aripiprazole Lauroxil) Trials in Adults with Schizophrenia Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions with Aripiprazole Lauroxil The most common adverse reaction (incidence ≥5% and at least twice the rate of placebo in patients treated with aripiprazole lauroxil) was akathisia. Adverse Reactions Occurring at an Incidence of 2% or More in Aripiprazole Lauroxil-Treated Patients Adverse reactions associated with the use of aripiprazole lauroxil (incidence of 2% or greater, rounded to the nearest percent and aripiprazole lauroxil incidence greater than placebo) that occurred were: injection site pain, increased weight, increased blood creatinine phosphokinase, akathisia, headache, insomnia, and restlessness. Injection Site Reactions ARISTADA INITIO In pharmacokinetic studies evaluating ARISTADA INITIO, the incidences of injection site reactions with ARISTADA INITIO were similar to the incidence observed with aripiprazole lauroxil. ARISTADA (Aripiprazole Lauroxil) Injection site reactions were reported by 4% of patients treated with 441 mg aripiprazole lauroxil and 5% of patients treated with 882 mg aripiprazole lauroxil compared to 2% of patients treated with placebo. Most of these were injection site pain (3%, 4% and 2% in the 441 mg aripiprazole lauroxil, 882 mg aripiprazole lauroxil and placebo groups, respectively). Other injection site reactions (induration, swelling and redness) occurred at less than 1%. Extrapyramidal Symptoms In a schizophrenia efficacy study in aripiprazole lauroxil-treated patients, the incidence of other EPS-related events, excluding akathisia and restlessness, was 5% and 7% for patients on 441 mg and 882 mg, respectively, versus 4% for placebo-treated patients. Dystonia Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies with Aripiprazole Lauroxil The following listing does not include reactions: 1) already listed in previous tables or elsewhere in labeling, 2) for which a drug cause was remote, 3) which were so general as to be uninformative, 4) which were not considered to have significant clinical implications, or 5) which occurred at a rate equal to or less than placebo. Cardiac – angina pectoris, tachycardia, palpitations Gastrointestinal disorders – constipation, dry mouth General disorders – asthenia Musculoskeletal – muscular weakness Nervous system disorders – dizziness Psychiatric disorders – anxiety, suicide Adverse Reactions Reported in Clinical Trials with Oral Aripiprazole The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported in clinical trials with oral aripiprazole and not reported above for ARISTADA INITIO or aripiprazole lauroxil. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: thrombocytopenia Cardiac Disorders: bradycardia, atrial flutter, cardiorespiratory arrest, atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cardiopulmonary failure Eye Disorders: photophobia, diplopia Gastrointestinal Disorders: gastroesophageal reflux disease General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: peripheral edema, chest pain, face edema Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatitis, jaundice Immune System Disorders: hypersensitivity Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications: fall, heat stroke Investigations: weight decreased, hepatic enzyme increased, blood glucose increased, blood lactate dehydrogenase increased, gamma glutamyl transferase increased, blood prolactin increased, blood urea increased, blood creatinine increased, blood bilirubin increased, electrocardiogram QT prolonged, glycosylated hemoglobin increased Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: anorexia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: muscle tightness, rhabdomyolysis, mobility decreased Nervous System Disorders: memory impairment, cogwheel rigidity, hypokinesia, bradykinesia, akinesia, myoclonus, coordination abnormal, speech disorder, choreoathetosis Psychiatric Disorders: aggression, loss of libido, delirium, libido increased, anorgasmia, tic, homicidal ideation, catatonia, sleep walking Renal and Urinary Disorders: urinary retention, nocturia Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: erectile dysfunction, gynaecomastia, menstruation irregular, amenorrhea, breast pain, priapism Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders: nasal congestion, dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: rash, hyperhidrosis, pruritus, photosensitivity reaction, alopecia, urticaria Vascular Disorders: hypotension, hypertension 6.2 Postmarketing Experience<br> The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of oral aripiprazole. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure: occurrences of allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, laryngospasm, pruritus/urticaria, or oropharyngeal spasm), pathological gambling, hiccups, blood glucose fluctuation, oculogyric crisis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).
