In the placebo-controlled studies, a total of 485 patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency, or non-diabetic autonomic neuropathy were randomized and treated, 245 with droxidopa and 240 with placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )].<br>Placebo-Controlled Experience<br>The most commonly observed adverse reactions (those occurring at an incidence of greater than 5% in the droxidopa group and with at least a 3% greater incidence in the droxidopa group than in the placebo group) in droxidopa-treated patients during the three placebo-controlled trials were headache, dizziness, nausea, and hypertension.

The safety evaluation of droxidopa is based on two placebo-controlled studies 1 week to 2 weeks in duration (Studies 301 and 302), one 8-week placebo-controlled study (Study 306), and two long-term, open-label extension studies (Studies 303 and 304). In the placebo-controlled studies, a total of 485 patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency, or non-diabetic autonomic neuropathy were randomized and treated, 245 with droxidopa and 240 with placebo [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. Placebo-Controlled Experience The most commonly observed adverse reactions (those occurring at an incidence of greater than 5% in the droxidopa group and with at least a 3% greater incidence in the droxidopa group than in the placebo group) in droxidopa-treated patients during the three placebo-controlled trials were headache, dizziness, nausea, and hypertension. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation from droxidopa were hypertension or increased blood pressure and nausea.

Adverse reactions that were reported in greater than 5% of patients in the droxidopa group and with at least a 3% greater incidence in the droxidopa group than in the placebo group were from Study 306.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac Disorders: Chest pain Eye Disorders: Blurred vision Gastrointestinal Disorders: Pancreatitis, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Fatigue Nervous System Disorders : Cerebrovascular accident Psychiatric Disorders: Psychosis, hallucination, delirium, agitation, memory disorder
