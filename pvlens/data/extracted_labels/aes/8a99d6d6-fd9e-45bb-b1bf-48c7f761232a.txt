The safety of PAXLOVID is based on two Phase 2/3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials in symptomatic adult subjects 18 years of age and older with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subjects in both studies received PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300 mg/100 mg) or placebo every 12 hours for 5 days for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 within 5 days of symptom onset [see Clinical Studies (14) ] : • Trial C4671005 (EPIC-HR) enrolled subjects who were at high risk for progression to severe disease. • Trial C4671002 (EPIC-SR) enrolled subjects who were at standard risk for progression to severe disease (previously unvaccinated subjects at standard risk or fully vaccinated subjects with at least 1 risk factor for progression to severe disease). Adverse reactions were those reported while subjects were on study medication and through 28 days after the last dose of study treatment. In Trial C4671005 (EPIC-HR), 1,038 subjects received PAXLOVID and 1,053 subjects received placebo. The most common adverse reactions (≥1% incidence in the PAXLOVID group and occurring at a greater frequency than in the placebo group) were dysgeusia (5% and <1%, respectively) and diarrhea (3% and 2%, respectively). Among vaccinated or unvaccinated subjects at standard risk or fully vaccinated subjects with at least 1 risk factor for progression to severe disease in Trial C4671002 (EPIC-SR), 540 subjects received PAXLOVID and 528 subjects received placebo. The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in EPIC-HR. Emergency Use Authorization Experience in Subjects with COVID-19 The following adverse reactions have been identified during use of PAXLOVID under Emergency Use Authorization. Immune System Disorders: Anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Nervous System Disorders: Headache Vascular Disorders: Hypertension Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Malaise
