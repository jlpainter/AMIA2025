The safety population from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study included 720 patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, who received NINLARO in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (NINLARO regimen; N=361) or placebo in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (placebo regimen; N=359). The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥20% with a difference of ≥5% compared to placebo) in the NINLARO regimen were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, diarrhea, constipation, peripheral neuropathy, nausea, peripheral edema, rash, vomiting, and bronchitis. Serious adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients in the NINLARO regimen included diarrhea (3%), thrombocytopenia (2%) and bronchitis (2%). One or more of the three drugs was permanently discontinued in 4% of patients reporting peripheral neuropathy, 3% of patients reporting diarrhea and 2% of patients reporting thrombocytopenia. Permanent discontinuation of NINLARO due to an adverse reaction occurred in 10% of patients. Table 4 summarizes the non-hematologic adverse reactions occurring in at least 5% of patients with at least a 5% difference between the NINLARO regimen and the placebo regimen.

The most common adverse reactions of the eyes were cataract (15%), conjunctivitis (9%), blurred vision (7%), and dry eye (6%). Other Clinical Trials Experience The following serious adverse reactions have each been reported at a frequency of <1% in patients treated with NINLARO: acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (Sweet's syndrome), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, transverse myelitis, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, tumor lysis syndrome, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. 6.2	Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of NINLARO. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
