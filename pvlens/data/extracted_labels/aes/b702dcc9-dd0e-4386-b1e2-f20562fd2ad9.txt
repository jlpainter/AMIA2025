The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:<br>The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than 10%) were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated alanine aminotransferase, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, elevated bilirubin, mucositis, cytomegalovirus infection, hemorrhage, diarrhea, hematuria and rash.

Adverse reactions with treatment of adenocarcinoma of the breast, adenocarcinoma of the ovary, malignant effusions and superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder Gastrointestinal : Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia. General : Fatigue, weakness. Febrile reaction and discharge from a subcutaneous lesion may occur as the result of breakdown of tumor tissue. Hypersensitivity Reactions : Allergic reactions - rash, urticaria, laryngeal edema, asthma, anaphylactic shock, wheezing. Local Reactions : Contact dermatitis, pain at the injection site. Neurologic : Dizziness, headache, blurred vision. Renal : Dysuria, urinary retention, chemical cystitis or hemorrhagic cystitis. Reproductive : Amenorrhea, interference with spermatogenesis. Respiratory : Prolonged apnea has been reported when succinylcholine was administered prior to surgery, following combined use of thiotepa and other anticancer agents. It was theorized that this was caused by decrease of pseudocholinesterase activity caused by the anticancer drugs. Skin : Dermatitis, alopecia. Skin depigmentation has been reported following topical use. Special Senses : Conjunctivitis. Pediatric use information is approved for Adienne SA’s TEPADINA (thiotepa) for Injection. However, due to Adienne SA’s marketing exclusivity rights, the drug product is not labeled with that information.<br>Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Psychiatric disorders: Delirium, depression, disorientation, suicidal ideation. Renal and urinary disorders: Renal failure, nephropathy toxic. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: Acute respiratory distress, aspiration, dyspnea exertional, interstitial lung disease, lung disorder, pneumonitis, pulmonary arteriopathy, pulmonary sepsis, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, respiratory distress, respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension.
