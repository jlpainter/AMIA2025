Adverse Reactions in Adolescent and Pediatric Subjects (6 months to 17 years of age) Assessment of adverse reactions is based on a randomized, active-controlled study in which 130 adolescent and pediatric subjects ages 6 months to 17 years of age with acute uncomplicated influenza received open-label treatment with a single dose of RAPIVAB (n = 107), or 5 days of treatment with oseltamivir (n = 23) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) , Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . The safety profile of RAPIVAB in subjects 6 months to 17 years of age was generally similar to that observed in adults.

The only clinically significant laboratory abnormality (DAIDS Grade 2) occurring in ≥2% of pediatric subjects treated with RAPIVAB (and not previously reported in adults) was proteinuria by dipstick analysis (3% versus 0% for oseltamivir). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of RAPIVAB. Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Dermatologic: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, rash [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Psychiatric: Abnormal behavior, hallucination [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .
