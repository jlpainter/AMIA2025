The incidences cited below are estimates of clinical reactions among 1003 subjects who participated in the short term (duration of 1 to 42 days) placebo-controlled clinical trials of Halcion. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in two multi-dose placebo controlled clinical trials include coordination disorders, drowsiness, grogginess, somnolence, depression, restlessness, dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, nausea, visual disturbance, nervousness, abdominal distress, bladder trouble, aching limbs, backache, and blepharitis. Table 1: Common Adverse Drug Reactions in 1% or More of Halcion-Treated Subjects (and Greater than Placebo) Reported in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials Event Halcion (N=1003) % Patients Reporting Placebo (N=997) % Patients Reporting Central Nervous System Drowsiness 14.0 6.4 Headache 9.7 8.4 Dizziness 7.8 3.1 Nervousness 5.2 4.5 Light-headedness 4.9 0.9 Coordination disorders/ataxia 4.6 0.8 Gastrointestinal Nausea/vomiting 4.6 3.7 In addition to the common reactions enumerated above in Table1, the following adverse reactions have been reported at an incidence of 0.9% to 0.5%: euphoria, tachycardia, tiredness, confusional states/memory impairment, cramps/pain, depression, and visual disturbances. Adverse reactions reported at an incidence less than 0.5% include: constipation, taste alterations, diarrhea, dry mouth, dermatitis/allergy, dreaming/nightmares, insomnia, paresthesia, tinnitus, dysesthesia, weakness, congestion, and death from hepatic failure in a patient also receiving diuretic drugs. 6.2	Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Halcion. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. General disorders and administration site conditions: Paradoxical drug reaction, chest pain and fatigue Gastrointestinal disorders: Tongue discomfort, glossitis, stomatitis Hepatobiliary disorders: Jaundice Injury, poisoning and procedural complications: Fall Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Anorexia Nervous system disorders : Anterograde amnesia, altered state of consciousness, dystonia, sedation, syncope, dysarthria and muscle spasticity Psychiatric disorders: Confusional state (disorientation, derealisation, depersonalization), mania, agitation, restlessness, irritability, sleep disorder and libido disorder, hallucination, delusion, aggression, somnambulism, and abnormal behavior Renal and urinary disorders: Urinary retention and urinary incontinence Reproductive system and breast disorders: Menstruation irregular Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Pruritis
