Of the TEGSEDI-treated patients, 69% were male and 94% were Caucasian, with a mean exposure of 385 days, and median exposure of 449 days. Baseline disease characteristics were largely similar in TEGSEDI-treated patients and patients in the placebo control group. Sixty-seven percent of patients were in Stage 1 of the disease at baseline, and 33% in Stage 2. Fifty-two percent of patients had Val30Met mutations in the TTR gene, with the remaining 48% comprised of 26 different other point mutations.<br>Table 2 presents common adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of TEGSEDI-treated patients and that occurred at least 5% more frequently or two times more frequently than on placebo.<br>The most common adverse reactions that occurred in at least 20% of TEGSEDI-treated patients and more frequently than on placebo were injection site reactions, nausea, headache, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and fever.

A total of 112 adult patients with polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR) received TEGSEDI in Study 1 and 60 patients received placebo. The, mean age of the study patients was 59 years (27 to 78 years of age).

Sixty-seven percent of patients were in Stage 1 of the disease at baseline, and 33% in Stage 2. Fifty-two percent of patients had Val30Met mutations in the TTR gene, with the remaining 48% comprised of 26 different other point mutations. Table 2 presents common adverse reactions that occurred in at least 5% of TEGSEDI-treated patients and that occurred at least 5% more frequently or two times more frequently than on placebo. The most common adverse reactions that occurred in at least 20% of TEGSEDI-treated patients and more frequently than on placebo were injection site reactions, nausea, headache, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and fever. Serious adverse reactions were more frequent in TEGSEDI-treated patients (32%) than in patients on placebo (21%). The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were thrombocytopenia and cachexia.

In addition, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to TEGSEDI in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading. In Study 1, 30% of TEGSEDI-treated patients tested positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) following 65 weeks of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 , 5.8 )] . However, the assay measured only IgG isotypes and the existence of other isotypes may be possible. In many cases adverse reactions occurred in patients with ADA, although the available data are too limited to make definitive conclusions about the relationship.
