Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia The safety of tretinoin capsules was evaluated in patients with APL who received tretinoin capsules at a dose of 22.5 mg/m 2 orally twice daily [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . The most common adverse reactions (≥30%) were headache, fever, skin/mucous membrane dryness, bone pain, malaise, shivering, upper respiratory tract disorders, dyspnea, hemorrhage, infections, nausea/vomiting, rash, peripheral edema, leukocytosis, pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, chest discomfort, abdominal pain.
