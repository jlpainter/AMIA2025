The clinical program for BEVESPI AEROSPHERE included 4,911 subjects with COPD in two 24-week lung function trials, one long-term safety extension study of 28 weeks, and 10 other trials of shorter duration. A total of 1,302 subjects have received at least 1 dose of BEVESPI AEROSPHERE. The safety data described below are based on the two 24-week trials and the one 28-week long-term safety extension trial. Adverse reactions observed in the other trials were similar to those observed in these confirmatory trials. 24-Week Trials The incidence of adverse reactions with BEVESPI AEROSPHERE in Table 1 is based on reports in two 24-week, placebo-controlled trials (Trials 1 and 2; n=2,100 and n=1,610, respectively). Of the 3,710 subjects, 56% were male and 91% were Caucasian. They had a mean age of 63 years and an average smoking history of 51 pack-years, with 54% identified as current smokers. At screening, the mean post-bronchodilator percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) was 51% (range: 19% to 82%) and the mean percent reversibility was 20% (range: -32% to 135%). Subjects received one of the following treatments: BEVESPI AEROSPHERE, glycopyrrolate 18 mcg, formoterol fumarate 9.6 mcg, or placebo twice daily or active control.

Long-Term Safety Extension Trial In a 28-week long-term safety extension trial, 893 subjects who successfully completed Trial 1 or Trial 2 were treated for up to an additional 28 weeks for a total treatment period of up to 52 weeks with BEVESPI AEROSPHERE, glycopyrrolate 18 mcg, formoterol fumarate 9.6 mcg administered twice daily or active control. Because the subjects continued from Trial 1 or Trial 2 into the safety extension trial, the demographic and baseline characteristics of the long-term safety extension trial were similar to those of the placebo-controlled efficacy trials described above. The adverse reactions reported in the long-term safety trial were consistent with those observed in the 24-week placebo-controlled trials. Additional Adverse Reactions : Other adverse reactions that have been associated with the component formoterol fumarate include: hypersensitivity reactions, hyperglycemia, sleep disturbance, agitation, restlessness, tremor, nausea, tachycardia, palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, and extrasystoles). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of BEVESPI AEROSPHERE. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. In postmarketing experience with BEVESPI AEROSPHERE, hypersensitivity and urinary retention have been reported.
