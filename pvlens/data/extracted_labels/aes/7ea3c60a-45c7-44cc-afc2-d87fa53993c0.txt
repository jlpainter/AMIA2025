The most common adverse reactions occurring in greater than 8% of AUSTEDO-treated patients were somnolence, diarrhea, dry mouth, and fatigue.

The studies described below were conducted with AUSTEDO tablets; adverse reactions with AUSTEDO XR extended-release tablets are expected to be similar to AUSTEDO tablets. Patients with Huntington’s Disease Study 1 [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] was a randomized, 12-week, placebo-controlled study in patients with chorea associated with Huntington’s disease. A total of 45 patients received AUSTEDO, and 45 patients received placebo. Patients ranged in age between 23 and 74 years (mean 54 years); 56% were male, and 92% were Caucasian. The most common adverse reactions occurring in greater than 8% of AUSTEDO-treated patients were somnolence, diarrhea, dry mouth, and fatigue. Adverse reactions occurring in 4% or more of patients treated with AUSTEDO, and with a greater incidence than in patients on placebo, are summarized in Table 3.

The most common adverse reaction resulting in dose reduction in patients receiving AUSTEDO was dizziness (4%). Agitation led to discontinuation in 2% of patients treated with AUSTEDO in Study 1. Patients with Tardive Dyskinesia The data described below reflect 410 tardive dyskinesia patients participating in clinical trials.
