In the clinical trial program of cladribine in MS, 1,976 patients received cladribine for a total of 9,509 patient years. The mean time on study including follow-up was approximately 4.8 years, and approximately 24% of cladribine-treated patients had approximately 8 years of time on study including follow-up. Of these, 923 patients aged 18 to 66 years received MAVENCLAD as monotherapy at a cumulative dose of 3.5 mg per kg. Table 2 shows adverse reactions in Study 1 [see Clinical Studies (14) ] with an incidence of at least 5% for MAVENCLAD and higher than placebo. The most common (> 20%) adverse reactions reported in Study 1 are upper respiratory tract infection, headache, and lymphopenia. Table 2 Adverse Reactions in Study 1 with an Incidence of at Least 5% for MAVENCLAD and Higher than Placebo MAVENCLAD (N=440) % Placebo (N=435) % Upper respiratory tract infection 38 32 Headache 25 19 Lymphopenia 24 2 Nausea 10 9 Back pain 8 6 Arthralgia and arthritis 7 5 Insomnia 6 4 Bronchitis 5 3 Hypertension 5 3 Fever 5 3 Depression 5 3 Hypersensitivity In clinical studies, 11% of MAVENCLAD patients had hypersensitivity adverse reactions, compared to 7% of placebo patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Alopecia Alopecia occurred in 3% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo patients. Myelodysplastic Syndrome Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome have been reported in patients that had received parenteral cladribine at a higher dosage than that approved for MAVENCLAD. These cases occurred several years after treatment. Herpes Meningoencephalitis Fatal herpes meningoencephalitis occurred in one MAVENCLAD-treated patient, at a higher dosage and longer duration of therapy than the approved MAVENCLAD dosage and in combination with interferon beta-1a treatment. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) SJS and TEN are identified risks of parenteral cladribine for the treatment of oncologic indications. Seizures In clinical studies, serious events of seizure occurred in 0.3% of MAVENCLAD-treated patients compared to 0 placebo patients. Serious events included generalized tonic-clonic seizures and status epilepticus. It is unknown whether these events were related to the effects of multiple sclerosis alone, to MAVENCLAD, or to a combination of both. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of MAVENCLAD. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Infections and Infestations: nocardiosis, varicella zoster, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and toxoplasmosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hepatobiliary Disorders: liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]
