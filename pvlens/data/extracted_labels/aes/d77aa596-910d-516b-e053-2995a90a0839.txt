Adverse Reactions from the Pooled Clinical Trials Including Trial 1 The pooled safety analysis from 3 clinical trials included 151 adult patients with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) treated with POMBILITI in combination with Opfolda including: 85 patients in the randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial in adults (Trial 1) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] , 37 patients in the open-label extension trial where patients switched from a non‑U.S.‑approved alglucosidase alfa product [see Clinical Studies (14) ] to POMBILITI in combination with Opfolda, 29 patients in an open-label trial. The total median duration of exposure in these trials was 21 months, with 120 patients having at least 12 months exposure to POMBILITI in combination with Opfolda. In these trials, 78% (n=117) of the patients received previous ERT (ERT‑experienced) with a mean treatment duration of 7.7 years. In these trials, serious adverse reactions reported in 2 or more patients treated with POMBILITI in combination with Opfolda were anaphylaxis and urticaria. A total of 5 patients treated with POMBILITI in combination with Opfolda in these trials permanently discontinued POMBILITI due to adverse reactions, including 4 of these patients who discontinued the treatment because of a serious adverse reaction. The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in the pooled safety population of patients treated with POMBILITI in combination with Opfolda in the 3 clinical trials were headache, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain and pyrexia. In these trials, IARs were reported in 48 (32%) patients treated with POMBILITI in combination with Opfolda. IARs reported in more than 1 patient included headache, myalgia, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, muscle spasms, pyrexia, dizziness, cough, chills, rash, vomiting, dyspnea, pain, abdominal distension, tachycardia, urticaria, flatulence, pruritus, abdominal pain, chest discomfort, flushing, hyperhidrosis, dysgeusia, hypotension, and hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Adverse Reactions from Trial 1 Trial 1 (a randomized, double‑blind, active‑controlled trial) included 123 adult patients with LOPD who were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive treatment with POMBILITI in combination with Opfolda or a non-U.S.-approved alglucosidase alfa product with placebo [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. The duration of exposure was similar for both treatment groups (overall mean exposure of 12 months). Most patients (77%) were ERT‑experienced, and a majority of patients in both treatment groups had >5 years of prior treatment with ERT (69% and 63% of patients in the POMBILITI in combination with Opfolda group and the non-U.S.-approved alglucosidase alfa product with placebo group, respectively). The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in the patients who received POMBILITI in combination with Opfolda in Trial 1 were headache and diarrhea. Table 2 summarizes frequent adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with POMBILITI in combination with Opfolda in Trial 1. Trial 1 was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions in the POMBILITI in combination with Opfolda and the non-U.S.-approved alglucosidase alfa product with placebo groups.
