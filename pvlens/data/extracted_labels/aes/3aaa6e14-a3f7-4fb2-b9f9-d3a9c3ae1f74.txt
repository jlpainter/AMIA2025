The most common side effects from treatment with DAXXIFY usually occur within one to two weeks after injection and, while generally transient, may have a duration of several weeks or months. Glabellar Lines In the two randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trials that assess the use of DAXXIFY for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe glabellar lines, GL-1 and GL-2, 406 subjects received a single-dose treatment of 40 Units DAXXIFY, and 203 subjects received placebo. The most frequent adverse reactions are presented in Table 3.
