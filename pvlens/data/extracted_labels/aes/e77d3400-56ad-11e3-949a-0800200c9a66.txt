6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information. Increased Risk of Stroke with Discontinuation of SAVAYSA in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Spinal/Epidural Anesthesia or Puncture [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Treatment of NVAF: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) are bleeding and anemia ( 6.1) Treatment of DVT and PE: The most common adverse reactions (≥ 1%) are bleeding, rash, abnormal liver function tests and anemia ( 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Daiichi Sankyo, Inc. at 1-877-437-7763 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of SAVAYSA was evaluated in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, Hokusai VTE, and Hokusai VTE Cancer studies including 11,530 patients exposed to SAVAYSA 60 mg and 7124 patients exposed to SAVAYSA 30 mg once daily [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 Study In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study, the median study drug exposure for the SAVAYSA and warfarin treatment groups was 2.5 years. Bleeding was the most common reason for treatment discontinuation. Bleeding led to treatment discontinuation in 3.9% and 4.1% of patients in the SAVAYSA 60 mg and warfarin treatment groups, respectively. In the overall population, major bleeding was lower in the SAVAYSA group compared to the warfarin group [HR 0.80 (0.70, 0.91), p < 0.001]. Table 6.1 shows major bleeding events (percentage of patients with at least one bleeding event, per year) for the indicated population (CrCL ≤ 95 mL/min). Table 6.1: Adjudicated Bleeding Events for NVAF Patients with CrCL ≤ 95 mL/min The on-treatment period is during treatment or within 2 days of stopping study treatment. The difference in hemorrhagic stroke rate from Table 14.1 is because Table 14.1 includes events occurring during treatment or within 3 days of stopping study treatment and this table only includes patients with CrCL ≤ 95 mL/min. Event A subject can be included in multiple sub-categories if he/she had an event for those categories. SAVAYSA 60 mg Includes all patients with CrCL ≤ 95 mL/min randomized to receive 60 mg once daily, including those who were dose-reduced to 30 mg once daily because of prespecified baseline conditions.

Lower GI tract bleeding includes rectal bleeds. 205 (1.8) 150 (1.3) 1.40 (1.13, 1.73) Fatal Bleeding Fatal bleed is a bleeding event during the on-treatment period and adjudicated as leading directly to death within 7 days. 21 (0.2) 42 (0.4) 0.51 (0.30, 0.86) ICH 19 (0.2) 36 (0.3) 0.54 (0.31, 0.94) Non-intracranial 2 (< 0.1) 6 (< 0.1) ---- The most common site of a major bleeding event was the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Table 6.2 shows the number of and the rate at which patients experienced GI bleeding in the SAVAYSA 60 mg and warfarin treatment groups. Table 6.2: Gastrointestinal Bleeding Events for NVAF Patients with CrCL ≤ 95 mL/min During or within 2 days of stopping study treatment SAVAYSA N = 5417 n (%/year) Warfarin N = 5485 n (%/year) Major Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding GI bleeding was defined by location as upper or lower GI 205 (1.78) 150 (1.27) Upper GI 123 (1.06) 88 (0.74) Lower GI Lower GI bleeding included anorectal bleeding 85 (0.73) 64 (0.54) GUSTO GUSTO – Severe or life-threatening bleeding that caused hemodynamic compromise and requires interventionSevere GI bleeding 16 (0.14) 17 (0.14) Fatal GI bleeding 1 (< 0.1) 2 (< 0.1) The rate of anemia-related adverse events was greater with SAVAYSA 60 mg than with warfarin (9.6% vs. 6.8%). The comparative rates of major bleeding on SAVAYSA and warfarin were generally consistent among subgroups ( see Figure 6.1). Bleeding rates appeared higher in both treatment arms (SAVAYSA and warfarin) in the following subgroups of patients: those receiving aspirin, those in the United States, those more than 75 years old and those with reduced renal function. Figure 6.1: Adjudicated Major Bleeding in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 During or within 2 days of stopping study treatmentStudy Note: The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and most of which were pre-specified. The 95% confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made, nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors. Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over-interpreted. Figure 6.1 Other Adverse Reactions The most common non-bleeding adverse reactions (≥ 1%) for SAVAYSA 60 mg versus warfarin were rash (4.2% vs. 4.1%), and abnormal liver function tests (4.8% vs. 4.6%), respectively. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) was reported as a serious adverse event on treatment for SAVAYSA 60 mg and warfarin in 15 (0.2%) and 7 (0.1%) patients, respectively. Many of the cases in both treatment groups were confounded by the use of amiodarone, which has been associated with ILD, or by infectious pneumonia. In the overall study period, there were 5 and 0 fatal ILD cases in the SAVAYSA 60 mg and warfarin groups, respectively. The Hokusai VTE Study The safety of SAVAYSA in the treatment of VTE was assessed in the Hokusai VTE study. The duration of drug exposure for SAVAYSA was ≤ 6 months for 1561 (37.9%) of patients, > 6 months for 2557 (62.1%) of patients and 12 months for 1661 (40.3%) of patients. Bleeding was the most common reason for treatment discontinuation and occurred in 1.4% and 1.4% of patients in the SAVAYSA and warfarin arms, respectively. Bleeding in Patients with DVT and/or PE in the Hokusai VTE Study The major safety outcome was Clinically Relevant Bleeding, defined as the composite of Major and Clinically Relevant Non-Major (CRNM) Bleeding that occurred during or within three days of stopping study treatment. The incidence of Clinically Relevant Bleeding was lower in SAVAYSA than warfarin [HR (95% CI): 0.81 (0.71, 0.94); p = 0.004]. Table 6.3 shows the number of patients experiencing bleeding events in the Hokusai VTE Study.

As compared to all patients who received SAVAYSA or warfarin in the 60 mg cohort, all patients who received SAVAYSA or warfarin in the 30 mg cohort (n = 1452, 17.6% of the entire study population) were older (60.1 vs 54.9 years), more frequently female (66.5% vs 37.7%), more frequently of Asian race (46.0% vs 15.6%) and had more co-morbidities (e.g., history of bleeding, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer). Clinically relevant bleeding events occurred in 58/733 (7.9%) of the SAVAYSA patients receiving 30 mg once daily and 92/719 (12.8%) of warfarin patients meeting the above criteria. In the Hokusai VTE study, among all patients the most common bleeding adverse reactions (≥ 1%) are shown in Table 6.4.

The median duration of SAVAYSA exposure was 211 days (range, 2 to 423). The safety outcome was major bleeding that occurred during or within three days of stopping study treatment. The incidence of major bleeding was higher in the SAVAYSA arm than in the dalteparin arm [HR (95% CI): 2.00 (1.09, 3.66)]. Table 6.5 presents the bleeding results from the Hokusai VTE Cancer study.

In patients without GI cancer at randomization, major bleeding occurred in 3.6% (14/386) in the SAVAYSA group and 3.3% (13/399) in the dalteparin group. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of SAVAYSA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders:thrombocytopenia Gastrointestinal disorders:abdominal pain Immune system disorders:angioedema, hypersensitivity Nervous system disorders:dizziness, headache Renal and urinary disorders:anticoagulant-related nephropathy Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:urticaria
