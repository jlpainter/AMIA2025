At Week 38, following an 8-week interruption of trial drug, mean LVEF was similar to baseline for both treatment groups. In the EXPLORER-HCM trial, 7 (6%) patients in the CAMZYOS group and 2 (2%) patients in the placebo group experienced reversible reductions in LVEF to <50% (median 48%: range 35-49%) while on treatment. In 3 of the 7 CAMZYOS patients and 1 of the 2 placebo patients, these reductions were asymptomatic. In all 7 patients treated with CAMZYOS, LVEF recovered following interruption of CAMZYOS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .<br>6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reaction is discussed in other sections of the labeling: â€¢ Heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Adverse reactions occurring in >5% of patients and more commonly on CAMZYOS than on placebo were dizziness (27%) and syncope (6%).

The safety of CAMZYOS was evaluated in EXPLORER-HCM, a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Of the 251 adults with obstructive HCM, 123 patients were treated with CAMZYOS 2.5-15 mg daily and 128 were treated with placebo. CAMZYOS-treated patients had a median duration of exposure of 30 weeks (range: 2-40 weeks). Syncope (0.8%) was the only adverse drug reaction leading to discontinuation in patients receiving CAMZYOS. Adverse reactions occurring in >5% of patients and more commonly on CAMZYOS than on placebo were dizziness (27% vs. 18%) and syncope (6% vs. 2%). The safety of CAMZYOS in patients was further evaluated in VALOR-HCM, a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Of the 112 adults with symptomatic obstructive HCM, 56 patients were treated with CAMZYOS 2.5-15 mg daily and 55 were treated with placebo. CAMZYOS-treated patients had a median duration of exposure of 17 weeks (range: 3-19 weeks). There were no new adverse reactions identified in VALOR-HCM. Effects on Systolic Function In the EXPLORER-HCM trial, mean (SD) resting LVEF was 74% (6) at baseline in both treatment groups. Consistent with the mechanism of action of CAMZYOS, mean (SD) absolute change from baseline in LVEF was -4% (8) in the CAMZYOS group and 0% (7) in the placebo group over the 30-week treatment period.
