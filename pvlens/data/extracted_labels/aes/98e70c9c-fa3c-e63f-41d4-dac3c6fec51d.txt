This trial included 1,095 TARGINIQ ER-treated patients in an open-label titration period, and 298 TARGINIQ ER-and 302 placebo-treated patients in a double-blind treatment period.

A total of 2,396 patients were treated in controlled and open-label clinical studies with TARGINIQ ER. Seven hundred and ninety-four of these patients (33%) were treated for approximately six months and 621 (26%) were treated for approximately one year. TARGINIQ ER may increase the risk of serious adverse reactions such as those observed with other opioid analgesics, including respiratory depression, apnea, respiratory arrest, circulatory depression, hypotension, or shock [see Overdosage ( 10 )] . Commonly Observed Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions in a Clinical Study with TARGINIQ ER in Opioid-Experienced Patients with Uncontrolled Moderate to Severe Chronic Low Back Pain The safety data described in Table 4 below are based on a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in opioid-experienced patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain. This trial included 1,095 TARGINIQ ER-treated patients in an open-label titration period, and 298 TARGINIQ ER-and 302 placebo-treated patients in a double-blind treatment period. The mean age was 52 years old; 55% were female, and 45% were male; 74% were Caucasian, 22% were Black, and 11% were Hispanic. The most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by ≥ 5% of TARGINIQ ER subjects) during the open-label or double-blind periods were nausea and vomiting. The most common reason for discontinuation during the open-label period due to treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by ≥ 1% of subjects) was nausea (2%). The most common reason for discontinuation during the double-blind period due to treatment-emergent adverse reactions (reported by ≥ 1% of subjects with TARGINIQ ER or placebo) was drug withdrawal syndrome (<1% vs. 1%), respectively. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse reactions reported by ≥ 2% of subjects in a clinical trial comparing TARGINIQ ER with placebo is shown in Table 4 below: Table 4. Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Reactions Reported in >2% of Subjects Taking TARGINIQ ER: Safety Population (Open-Label Titration Period) and Randomized Safety Population (Double-Blind Period) *Percentages in the table are based on adverse reaction reports of Drug Withdrawal Syndrome in the key efficacy and safety study. In addition to the adverse reaction reports, an independent Adjudication Committee identified additional subjects with possible drug withdrawal syndrome, resulting in a total (adverse reactions plus adjudicated cases) of 2% of subjects in the Open-Label Period, and in the Double-Blind Period 4% of subjects treated with TARGINIQ ER and 2% treated with placebo.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Gastrointestinal Disorders: abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: drug withdrawal syndrome, fatigue, pain, malaise, and drug ineffective Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications: inadequate analgesia Neoplasms Benign, Malignant, and Unspecified (including cysts and polyps): malignant neoplasm progression Nervous System Disorders: dizziness, headache, tremor, and somnolence Psychiatric Disorders: restlessness, confusional state, and anxiety Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders: dyspnea Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: hyperhidrosis and pruritus Serotonin syndrome : Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition, have been reported during concomitant use of opioids with serotonergic drugs. Adrenal insufficiency : Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Anaphylaxis : Anaphylaxis has been reported with ingredients contained in TARGINIQ ER. Androgen deficiency : Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.2 )].
