Safety data for patients in Study 3 are similar to those listed in Table 1. Study 4 (n=844) was a Phase 3, 52-week, multi-center, open-label, randomized, parallel group, safety and tolerability study of naloxegol versus usual care treatment for OIC (as determined by the investigator and excluding peripheral opioid antagonists) in patients with non-cancer related pain. The population enrolled in Study 4 was similar to that of the other studies. Eligible patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either naloxegol 25 mg once daily or usual care treatment for OIC. The most commonly used laxatives in the usual care group were rectal stimulants (e.g., bisacodyl), oral stimulants (e.g., senna), and oral osmotics (e.g., macrogol, magnesium).

The data described below reflect exposure to MOVANTIK in 1497 patients in clinical trials, including 537 patients exposed for greater than six months, and 320 patients exposed for 12 months. The safety data described in Table 1 are derived from two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1 and 2) in patients with OIC and non-cancer related pain [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .

Safety data for patients in Study 4 are similar to those listed in Table 1. Table 1 lists adverse reactions in pooled Studies 1 and 2 occurring in ≥3% of patients receiving MOVANTIK 12.5 mg or 25 mg and at an incidence greater than placebo. Table 1.

Because reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions : angioedema, rash, and urticaria. Gastrointestinal disorders : Gastrointestinal perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .
