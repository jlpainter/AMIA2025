Adult Patients Adverse reactions were evaluated for 1425 adult patients treated with SIVEXTRO in two Phase 2 and four Phase 3 clinical trials (three Phase 3 trials for 6 days of therapy and one Phase 3 trial for 7-21 days of therapy). The median age of adult patients treated with SIVEXTRO in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials was 44 years, ranging between 17 and 94 years old. The majority of adult patients treated with SIVEXTRO were male (66%) and White (67%). Serious Adverse Reactions and Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Adults Serious adverse reactions occurred in 37/1425 (2.6%) of adult patients treated with SIVEXTRO and in 25/1000 (2.5%) of adult patients treated with the comparator. SIVEXTRO was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 14/1425 (1%) of adult patients and the comparator was discontinued due to an adverse reaction in 13/1000 (1.3%) of adult patients. Most Common Adverse Reactions in Adults The most common adverse reactions in adult patients treated with SIVEXTRO were nausea (7.1%), headache (4.5%), diarrhea (3.6%), vomiting (2.7%), and dizziness (1.6%). The median time of onset of adverse reactions was 5 days for both SIVEXTRO and linezolid with 12% occurring on the second day of treatment in both treatment groups.

In postmarketing experience, thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients treated with SIVEXTRO. In one postmarketing report, patients who experienced thrombocytopenia were treated with tedizolid for a median duration of 26.5 days. A duration of treatment beyond 6 days is not approved . Peripheral and Optic Neuropathy Peripheral and optic neuropathy have been described in patients treated with another member of the oxazolidinone class for longer than 28 days. In Phase 3 trials in adults, reported adverse reactions for peripheral neuropathy and optic nerve disorders were similar between both treatment arms (peripheral neuropathy 1.2% vs. 0.7% for tedizolid phosphate and linezolid, respectively; optic nerve disorders 0.3% vs. 0.1%, respectively). Pediatric Patients Adverse reactions were evaluated in 91 pediatric patients with ABSSSI ranging from 12 to <18 years of age treated with IV and/or oral SIVEXTRO 200 mg for 6 days and 29 patients treated with comparator agents for 10 days. The majority of pediatric patients treated with SIVEXTRO were male (64%) and white (88%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 1/91 (1%) of pediatric patients treated with SIVEXTRO and in none of the 29 patients treated with the comparator. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation occurred in 1 (1%) pediatric patient in the SIVEXTRO arm and in none in the comparator arm. The most common adverse reactions occurring in pediatric patients receiving SIVEXTRO in the ABSSSI clinical trial were phlebitis (3%), increased hepatic transaminases (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase), (3%), anemia, and vomiting (1%).
