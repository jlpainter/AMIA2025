A 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of Vimizim was conducted in 176 patients with MPS IVA, ages 5 to 57 years old. Approximately half of the patients (49%) were male. Of the 176 patients, 65% were White, 23% Asian, 3% Black, and 10% Other race. The majority of patients (78%) were non-Hispanic. Patients were randomized to three treatment groups: Vimizim 2 mg/kg once per week (n=58), Vimizim 2 mg/kg once every other week (n=59), or placebo (n=59). All patients were treated with antihistamines prior to each infusion. Table 1 summarizes the most common adverse reactions that occurred in the placebo-controlled trial with an incidence of ≥ 10% in patients treated with Vimizim 2 mg/kg once per week and with a higher incidence than in the placebo-treated patients.

No new adverse reactions were reported. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other elosulfase alfa products may be misleading. All patients treated with Vimizim 2 mg/kg once per week in the placebo-controlled trial developed antidrug antibodies by Week 4. Anti-drug antibody titers were sustained or increased for the duration of Vimizim treatment. Because all patients developed anti-drug antibodies, associations between antibody titers and reductions in treatment effect or the occurrence of anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions could not be determined. All patients treated with Vimizim 2 mg/kg once per week tested positive for neutralizing antibodies capable of inhibiting the drug from binding to the mannose-6-phosphate receptor at least once during the trial. Binding to this receptor is required for Vimizim to be taken into cells where it is active. Neutralizing antibody titers were not determined in the patients. Therefore, the possibility of an association between neutralizing antibody titer and treatment effect cannot be assessed.
