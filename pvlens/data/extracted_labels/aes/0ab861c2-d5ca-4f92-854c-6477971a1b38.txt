The safety of pirfenidone has been evaluated in more than 1400 subjects with over 170 subjects exposed to pirfenidone for more than 5 years in clinical trials. ESBRIET was studied in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3) in which a total of 623 patients received 2403 mg/day of ESBRIET and 624 patients received placebo. Subjects ages ranged from 40 to 80 years (mean age of 67 years). Most patients were male (74%) and Caucasian (95%). The mean duration of exposure to ESBRIET was 62 weeks (range: 2 to 118 weeks) in these 3 trials. At the recommended dosage of 2403 mg/day, 14.6% of patients on ESBRIET compared to 9.6% on placebo permanently discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The most common (>1%) adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were rash and nausea. The most common (>3%) adverse reactions leading to dosage reduction or interruption were rash, nausea, diarrhea, and photosensitivity reaction. The most common adverse reactions with an incidence of ≥10% and more frequent in the ESBRIET than placebo treatment group are listed in Table 2 . Table 2. Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥10% of ESBRIET-Treated Patients and More Commonly Than Placebo in Studies 1, 2, and 3 1 Includes abdominal pain, upper abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and stomach discomfort. % of Patients (0 to 118 Weeks) Adverse Reaction ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (N = 623) Placebo (N = 624) Nausea 36% 16% Rash 30% 10% Abdominal Pain 1 24% 15% Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 27% 25% Diarrhea 26% 20% Fatigue 26% 19% Headache 22% 19% Dyspepsia 19% 7% Dizziness 18% 11% Vomiting 13% 6% Anorexia 13% 5% Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease 11% 7% Sinusitis 11% 10% Insomnia 10% 7% Weight Decreased 10% 5% Arthralgia 10% 7% Adverse reactions occurring in ≥5 to <10% of ESBRIET-treated patients and more commonly than placebo are photosensitivity reaction (9% vs. 1%), decreased appetite (8% vs. 3%), pruritus (8% vs. 5%), asthenia (6% vs. 4%), dysgeusia (6% vs. 2%), and non-cardiac chest pain (5% vs. 4%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions identified from clinical trials the following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of pirfenidone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency.
