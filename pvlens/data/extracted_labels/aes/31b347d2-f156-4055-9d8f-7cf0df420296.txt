In Study 1 [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] , the adverse reactions that were associated with deflazacort treatment discontinuation, in decreasing order of frequency, were weight increased, obesity, cataract, and sleep disorder. Most Common Adverse Reactions in Clinical Studies Table 1 lists the adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 5% of patients in the 0.9 mg/kg/day deflazacort-treated group and that occurred more frequently than in placebo patients in Study 1, which included patients with DMD between the ages of 5 and 15 years. Table 1: Adverse Reactions that Occurred in ≥ 5% of Deflazacort-Treated Patients and Occurred More Frequently than in Placebo Patients with DMD (Study 1) 1 At 12 weeks placebo patients were re-randomized to receive either deflazacort or an active comparator. Adverse Reaction Deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/d (N=51) % at 12 weeks Placebo (N=50) % at 12 weeks 1 Cushingoid appearance 33 12 Weight increased 20 6 Increased appetite 14 2 Upper respiratory tract infection 12 10 Cough 12 6 Pollakiuria 12 2 Nasopharyngitis 10 6 Hirsutism 10 2 Central obesity 10 4 Erythema 8 6 Irritability 8 4 Rhinorrhea 8 0 Abdominal discomfort 6 2 Common adverse reactions (≥ 5% of deflazacort-treated patients) that occurred over 52 weeks of exposure to deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day in Study 1 and at a higher rate than deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day in the 12-week placebo-controlled phase of the trial include Cushingoid appearance (60%), hirsutism (35%), weight increased (28%), erythema (28%), central obesity (25%), abdominal pain/abdominal pain upper (18% combined), pollakiuria (15%), constipation (10%), irritability (10%), abnormal behavior (9%), pyrexia (9%), back pain (7%), rash (7%), contusion (6%), nausea (6%), psychomotor hyperactivity (6%), epistaxis (6%), and skin striae (6%). Study 1 also evaluated a higher dosage of deflazacort (1.2 mg/kg/day). Compared with the 0.9 mg/kg/day dosage, deflazacort 1.2 mg/kg/day over 52 weeks was associated with a higher incidence of certain adverse reactions, including Cushingoid appearance (69%), erythema (49%), hirsutism (37%), headache (34%), weight increased (32%), constipation (15%), abdominal pain upper (14%), skin striae (11%), acne (11%), and abdominal discomfort (8%). As there was no additional benefit with the 1.2 mg/kg/day dose of deflazacort, use of EMFLAZA 1.2 mg/kg/day is not recommended for the treatment of DMD [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . In an additional clinical study of two years duration with extended follow-up (Study 2), many of the same adverse reactions were observed. In addition, musculoskeletal events associated with long-term steroid use were also observed, including muscle weakness, tendon disorder, and osteopenia. Less Common Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies Other adverse reactions (≥ 1% frequency in any deflazacort treatment group and greater than placebo) that were observed during the 12-week placebo-controlled phase of Study 1 are shown below.
