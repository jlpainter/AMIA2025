Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to KYBELLA exposure. Administration site conditions : injection site ulceration, necrosis, infection, alopecia, and scarring. Immune System Disorders: Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, and itching. Nervous System Disorders: Oral hypoaesthesia and oral paraesthesia. Procedural Complications: Vascular injury due to inadvertent intravascular injection.
