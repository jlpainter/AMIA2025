UPTRAVI Tablets The safety of UPTRAVI tablets has been evaluated in a long-term, placebo-controlled study enrolling 1,156 patients with symptomatic PAH (GRIPHON study) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The exposure to UPTRAVI in this trial was up to 4.2 years with median duration of exposure of 1.4 years. Table 2 presents adverse reactions more frequent on UPTRAVI tablets than on placebo by ≥3%. Table 2: Adverse Reactions UPTRAVI Placebo Adverse Reaction N=575 N=577 Headache 65% 32% Diarrhea 42% 18% Jaw pain 26% 6% Nausea 33% 18% Myalgia 16% 6% Vomiting 18% 9% Pain in extremity 17% 8% Flushing 12% 5% Arthralgia 11% 8% Anemia 8% 5% Decreased appetite 6% 3% Rash 11% 8% These adverse reactions are more frequent during the dose titration phase. Hyperthyroidism was observed in 1% (n=8) of patients on UPTRAVI tablets and in none of the patients on placebo. UPTRAVI for Injection Infusion-site reactions (infusion site erythema/redness, pain and swelling) were reported with UPTRAVI for Injection. Laboratory Test Abnormalities Hemoglobin In a Phase 3 placebo-controlled study in patients with PAH, mean absolute changes in hemoglobin at regular visits compared to baseline ranged from −0.34 to −0.02 g/dL in the UPTRAVI group compared to −0.05 to 0.25 g/dL in the placebo group. A decrease in hemoglobin concentration to below 10 g/dL was reported in 8.6% of patients treated with UPTRAVI tablets and 5.0% of placebo-treated patients. Thyroid Function Tests In a Phase 3 placebo-controlled study in patients with PAH, a reduction (up to −0.3 MU/L from a baseline median of 2.5 MU/L) in median thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was observed at most visits in the UPTRAVI group. In the placebo group, little change in median values was apparent. There were no mean changes in triiodothyronine or thyroxine in either group. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of UPTRAVI. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
