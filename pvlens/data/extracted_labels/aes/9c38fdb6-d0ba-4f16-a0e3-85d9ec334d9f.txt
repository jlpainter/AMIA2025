Clinical Trials in Adults During the darunavir clinical development program, where darunavir was co-administered with ritonavir 100 mg once or twice daily, the most common clinical adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 5%) of at least moderate intensity (greater than or equal to Grade 2) were diarrhea, nausea, rash, headache, abdominal pain, and vomiting. See the darunavir full prescribing information for additional information on adverse reactions reported with darunavir co-administered with ritonavir. See cobicistat full prescribing information for clinical trial information on adverse reactions reported with cobicistat. One single arm clinical trial was conducted with darunavir and cobicistat administered as single entities in 313 subjects with HIV-1 infection. Adverse reactions evaluated through Week 24 did not differ substantially from those reported in clinical trials with darunavir co-administered with ritonavir. Clinical Trials in Pediatric Patients No clinical trials with PREZCOBIX were performed in pediatric patients.

Safety analyses of this trial in these pediatric subjects did not identify new safety concerns compared to the known safety profile of PREZCOBIX in adult subjects [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of darunavir. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Redistribution of body fat Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Rhabdomyolysis (associated with co-administration with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) Renal and Urinary Disorders Crystal nephropathy, crystalluria Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .
