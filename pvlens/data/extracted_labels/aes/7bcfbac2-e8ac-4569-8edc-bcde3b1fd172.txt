Adverse Reactions in Adults with Primary Hyperlipidemia The data in Table 1 are derived from 9 primary hyperlipidemia placebo-controlled trials that included 2,476 adult patients treated with PRALUENT 75 mg and/or 150 mg every 2 weeks, including 2,135 exposed for 6 months and 1,999 exposed for more than 1 year (median treatment duration of 65 weeks). The mean age of the population was 59 years, 40% of the population were female, 90% were White, 4% were Black or African American, 3% were Asian, and 3% other races; 6% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of PRALUENT-treated patients, and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients, are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in >2% of PRALUENT-Treated Adult Patients and â‰¥1% More Frequently Than with Placebo Adverse Reactions Placebo (N=1,276) % PRALUENT 75 mg every 2 weeks and 150 mg every 2 weeks combined (N=2,476) % Injection site reactions Includes erythema/redness, itching, swelling, pain/tenderness 5 7 Influenza 5 6 Diarrhea 4 5 Myalgia 3 4 Muscle spasms 2 3 Contusion 1 2 Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 5.3% of patients treated with PRALUENT and 5.1% of patients treated with placebo. The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation in patients treated with PRALUENT were allergic reactions (0.6% versus 0.2% for PRALUENT and placebo, respectively) and elevated liver enzymes (0.3% versus <0.1%). In an analysis of ezetimibe-controlled trials in which 864 patients were exposed to PRALUENT for a median of 27 weeks and 618 patients were exposed to ezetimibe for a median of 24 weeks, the types and frequencies of common adverse reactions were similar to those listed above. Adverse Reactions in a Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial in Adults In a cardiovascular outcomes trial in which 9,451 patients were exposed to PRALUENT for a median of 31 months and 9,443 patients were exposed to placebo for a median of 32 months, common adverse reactions (greater than 5% of patients treated with PRALUENT and occurring more frequently than placebo) included myalgia (6% PRALUENT, 5% placebo). Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with HeFH In a 24-week placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 101 pediatric patients aged 8 to 17 years with HeFH were exposed to PRALUENT and 52 pediatric patients with HeFH were exposed to placebo [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ], the safety profile of PRALUENT observed in this population was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults with HeFH. Other Adverse Reactions Local Injection Site Reactions In a pool of placebo-controlled trials evaluating PRALUENT 75 mg and/or 150 mg administered every 2 weeks in adults, local injection site reactions including erythema/redness, itching, swelling, and pain/tenderness were reported more frequently in patients treated with PRALUENT (7.2% versus 5.1% for PRALUENT and placebo, respectively). Few patients discontinued treatment because of these reactions (0.2% versus 0.4% for PRALUENT and placebo, respectively), but patients receiving PRALUENT had a greater number of injection site reactions, had more reports of associated symptoms, and had reactions of longer average duration than patients receiving placebo. In a 48-week placebo-controlled trial evaluating PRALUENT 300 mg every 4 weeks and 75 mg every 2 weeks in adults, in which all patients received an injection of drug or placebo every 2 weeks, local injection site reactions were reported more frequently in patients treated with PRALUENT 300 mg every 4 weeks as compared to those receiving PRALUENT 75 mg every 2 weeks or placebo (16.6%, 9.6%, and 7.9%, respectively). Three patients (0.7%) treated with PRALUENT 300 mg every 4 weeks discontinued treatment due to local injection site reactions versus no patients (0%) in the other 2 treatment groups. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial in adults, local injection site reactions were reported in 3.8% of patients treated with PRALUENT versus 2.1% patients treated with placebo, and led to permanent discontinuation in 26 patients (0.3%) versus 3 patients (<0.1%), respectively. In the trial of pediatric patients with HeFH, local injection site reactions were reported in 5% of patients treated with PRALUENT versus 0% patients treated with placebo; no patients discontinued treatment due to injection site reactions. Hypersensitivity Reactions in Adults Hypersensitivity reactions were reported more frequently in adult patients treated with PRALUENT than in those treated with placebo (8.6% versus 7.8%). The most common hypersensitivity reaction was pruritus (1.1% versus 0.4% for PRALUENT and placebo, respectively). The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to allergic reactions was higher among those treated with PRALUENT (0.6% versus 0.2%). Serious allergic reactions, such as hypersensitivity, nummular eczema, and hypersensitivity vasculitis were reported in patients using PRALUENT in controlled clinical trials. Liver Enzyme Abnormalities in Adults In the primary hyperlipidemia trials in adults, liver-related disorders (primarily related to abnormalities in liver enzymes) were reported in 2.5% of patients treated with PRALUENT and 1.8% of patients treated with placebo, leading to treatment discontinuation in 0.4% and 0.2% of patients, respectively. Increases in serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1.7% of patients treated with PRALUENT and 1.4% of patients treated with placebo. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of PRALUENT. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
