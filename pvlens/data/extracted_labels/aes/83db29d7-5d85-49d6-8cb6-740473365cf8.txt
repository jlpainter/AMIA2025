Most common adverse reactions seen with atazanavir coadministered with cobicistat (greater than 5%, Grades 2-4) are jaundice and rash.

Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trial Experience in Adult Subjects The safety of atazanavir and cobicistat coadministered as single agents is based on Week 144 data from a Phase 3 trial, Study GS-US-216-0114, in which 692 antiretroviral treatment-naive subjects with HIV-1 infection received: • atazanavir coadministered with cobicistat and emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (N=344) or • atazanavir coadministered with ritonavir and emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (N=348). The most common adverse reactions (Grades 2-4) and reported in ≥5% of subjects in the atazanavir coadministered with cobicistat group were jaundice (6%) and rash (5%). The proportion of subjects who discontinued study treatment due to adverse events regardless of severity, was 11% in both the atazanavir coadministered with cobicistat and atazanavir coadministered with ritonavir groups. Table 2 lists the frequency of adverse reactions (Grades 2-4) occurring in at least 2% of subjects in the atazanavir coadministered with cobicistat group in Study GS-US-216-0114.

Less Common Adverse Reactions Selected adverse reactions of at least moderate severity (≥ Grade 2) occurring in less than 2% of subjects receiving atazanavir coadministered with cobicistat and emtricitabine/tenofovir DF are listed below. These events have been included because of investigator’s assessment of potential causal relationship and were considered serious or have been reported in more than one subject treated with atazanavir coadministered with cobicistat, and reported with greater frequency compared with the atazanavir coadministered with ritonavir group. Gastrointestinal Disorders: vomiting, upper abdominal pain General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: fatigue Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: rhabdomyolysis Psychiatric Disorders: depression, abnormal dreams, insomnia Renal and Urinary Disorders: nephropathy, Fanconi syndrome acquired, nephrolithiasis Laboratory Abnormalities The frequency of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3-4) occurring in at least 2% of subjects in the atazanavir coadministered with cobicistat group in Study GS-US-216-0114 is presented in Table 3.

Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Subjects Although no clinical trial with EVOTAZ as the fixed-dose tablet was conducted in a pediatric population, the safety of atazanavir coadministered with cobicistat plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors was evaluated in treatment-experienced virologically suppressed subjects with HIV-1 infection between the ages of 12 to less than 18 years (N=14) through Week 48 in an open-label clinical trial (Study GS-US-216-0128) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Results from this study showed that the safety profile of atazanavir and cobicistat coadministered with a background regimen was similar to that in adults. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience See the full prescribing information for atazanavir for postmarketing information on atazanavir.
