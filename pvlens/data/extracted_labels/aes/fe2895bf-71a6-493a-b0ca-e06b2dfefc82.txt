Demographic characteristics were comparable between the TRULANCE and placebo groups in all studies [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC) The safety data described below reflect data from 1,733 adult patients with CIC randomized in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (Study 1 and Study 2) to receive placebo or 3 mg of TRULANCE once daily for 12 weeks. Most Common Adverse Reactions Table 1 provides the incidence of adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of CIC patients in the TRULANCE-treated group and at an incidence that was greater than in the placebo group. Table 1: Most Common Adverse Reactions a in Two Placebo-Controlled Trials of TRULANCE [Study 1 and Study 2] in Patients with CIC Adverse Reaction TRULANCE, 3 mg (N = 863) % Placebo (N = 870) % a: Reported in at least 2% of TRULANCE-treated patients with CIC and at an incidence greater than placebo. b: Verbatim reports of diarrhea were recorded as adverse reactions; reports of loose stools and increase in stool frequency were recorded as adverse reactions if they were also reported to be bothersome to the patient. Diarrheaᵇ 5 1 Diarrhea The majority of reported cases of diarrhea occurred within 4 weeks of treatment initiation. Severe diarrhea was reported in 0.6% of TRULANCE-treated patients compared to 0.3% of placebo-treated patients. Severe diarrhea was reported to occur within the first 3 days of treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 4% of TRULANCE-treated patients and 2% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was diarrhea: 2% of TRULANCE-treated patients and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients withdrew due to diarrhea .

Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C) The safety data described below reflect data from 1,449 adults patients with IBS-C randomized in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (Study 3 and Study 4) to receive placebo or 3 mg TRULANCE once daily for 12 weeks. Most Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 provides the incidence of adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of IBS-C patients treated with TRULANCE and at an incidence that was greater than in the placebo group. Table 2: Most Common Adverse Reactions a in Two Placebo-Controlled Trials of TRULANCE [Study 3 and Study 4] in Patients with IBS-C Adverse Reaction TRULANCE, 3 mg (N = 723) % Placebo (N = 726) % a: Reported in at least 2% of TRULANCE-treated patients with IBS-C and at an incidence greater than placebo. b: Verbatim reports of diarrhea were recorded as adverse reactions; reports of loose stools and increase in stool frequency were recorded as adverse reactions if they were also reported to be bothersome to the patient. Diarrhea b 4.3 1 Diarrhea The majority of reported cases of diarrhea occurred within 4 weeks of treatment initiation. Severe diarrhea was reported in 1% of TRULANCE-treated patients compared to 0.1% of placebo-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Severe diarrhea was reported to occur within the first day of treatment. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 2.5% of TRULANCE-treated patients and 0.4% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was diarrhea: 1.2% of TRULANCE-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients withdrew due to diarrhea .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to TRULANCE exposure. Hypersensitivity Reactions : skin itching, hives, rash Vomiting
