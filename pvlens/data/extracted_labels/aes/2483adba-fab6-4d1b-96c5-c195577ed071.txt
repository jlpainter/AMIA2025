Two hundred eighty-one patients (72%) were adults (18 years and older), 50 (13%) were adolescents (12 years up to less than 18 years), 55 (14%) were children (2 years up to less than 12 years), and five (1%) were infants (1 month up to less than 2 years).

The following adverse reactions are based on pooled data from two randomized trials in adult and adolescent patients (HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 3), one single-arm trial in adult and adolescent patients (HAVEN 4), one single-arm trial in pediatric patients (HAVEN 2), and one dose-finding trial, in which a total of 391 male patients with hemophilia A received at least one dose of HEMLIBRA as routine prophylaxis. Two hundred eighty-one patients (72%) were adults (18 years and older), 50 (13%) were adolescents (12 years up to less than 18 years), 55 (14%) were children (2 years up to less than 12 years), and five (1%) were infants (1 month up to less than 2 years). The median duration of exposure across the studies was 34.1 weeks (0.1 to 224.4 weeks). The most frequently reported adverse reactions observed in ≥ 10% of patients treated with HEMLIBRA were injection site reactions, headache, and arthralgia. Four patients (1%) in the clinical trials receiving HEMLIBRA prophylaxis withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions, which were thrombotic microangiopathy, skin necrosis and superficial thrombophlebitis, headache, and injection site reaction. Adverse reactions observed in patients who received HEMLIBRA are shown in Table 2 .

No TMA or thrombotic events were associated with the remaining instances of aPCC treatment.

Other Less Common (<1%) Reactions Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis was reported in two adult patients with asymptomatic elevations in serum creatine kinase without associated renal or musculoskeletal symptoms. In both instances, the event occurred following an increase in physical activity. 6.2	Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of HEMLIBRA. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
