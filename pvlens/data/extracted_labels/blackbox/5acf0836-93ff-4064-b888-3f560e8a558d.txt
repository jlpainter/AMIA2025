(A) EXCESSIVE HYPOTENSION:<br>Sodium Nitroprusside can cause precipitous decreases in blood pressure which can lead to irreversible ischemic injuries or death. Use only with continuous blood pressure monitoring [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ).<br>(B) CYANIDE TOXICITY:<br>Sodium nitroprusside metabolism produces dose-related cyanide, which can be lethal. A patient’s ability to buffer cyanide will be exceeded in less than one hour at the maximum dose rate (10 mcg/kg/min); limit infusions at the maximum rate to as short a duration as possible [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )].<br>WARNING: (A) EXCESSIVE HYPOTENSION; (B) CYANIDE TOXICITY<br>(A) Sodium Nitroprusside can cause precipitous decreases in blood pressure which can lead to irreversible ischemic injuries or death.
