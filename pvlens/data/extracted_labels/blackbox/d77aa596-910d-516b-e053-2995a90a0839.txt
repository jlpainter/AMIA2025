Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis Patients treated with POMBILITI have experienced life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis. Appropriate medical support measures, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment, should be readily available during POMBILITI administration. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) occurs, POMBILITI should be discontinued immediately, and appropriate medical treatment should be initiated. In patients with severe hypersensitivity reaction, desensitization measures to POMBILITI may be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].<br>Infusion-Associated Reactions (IARs) Patients treated with POMBILITI have experienced severe IARs. If severe IARs occur, immediately discontinue the POMBILITI infusion, initiate appropriate medical treatment, and assess the benefits and risks of readministering POMBILITI following severe IARs. Patients with an acute underlying illness at the time of POMBILITI infusion may be at greater risk for IARs. Patients with advanced Pompe disease may have compromised cardiac and respiratory function, which may predispose them to a higher risk of severe complications from IARs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ].<br>Risk of Acute Cardiorespiratory Failure in Susceptible Patients Patients susceptible to fluid volume overload, or those with acute underlying respiratory illness or compromised cardiac or respiratory function for whom fluid restriction is indicated may be at risk of serious exacerbation of their cardiac or respiratory status during POMBILITI infusion. More frequent monitoring of vitals should be performed during POMBILITI infusion in such patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ].<br>WARNING: SEVERE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS, INFUSION-ASSOCIATED REACTIONS, and RISK OF ACUTE CARDIORESPIRATORY FAILURE IN SUSCEPTIBLE PATIENTS<br>See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning<br>WARNING: SEVERE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS, INFUSION-ASSOCIATED REACTIONS, and RISK OF ACUTE CARDIORESPIRATORY FAILURE IN SUSCEPTIBLE PATIENTS Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis Patients treated with POMBILITI have experienced life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.
