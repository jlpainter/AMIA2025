WARNING: (A) REDUCED EFFICACY IN NONVALVULAR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION PATIENTS WITH CREATININE CLEARANCE (CRCL) > 95 ML/MIN (B) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF SAVAYSA INCREASES THE RISK OF ISCHEMIC EVENTS (C) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA<br>See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.<br>(A) REDUCED EFFICACY IN NONVALVULAR ATRIAL FIBRILLATION PATIENTS WITH CRCL > 95 ML/MIN: SAVAYSA should not be used in patients with CrCL > 95 mL/min. In the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients with CrCL > 95 mL/min had an increased rate of ischemic stroke with SAVAYSA 60 mg once daily compared to patients treated with warfarin. In these patients another anticoagulant should be used ( 5.1 ).<br>(B) PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF SAVAYSA INCREASES THE RISK OF ISCHEMIC EVENTS: Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of ischemic events. If SAVAYSA is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant as described in the transition guidance ( 2.4 , 5.2 , 14 ).<br>(C) SPINAL/EPIDURAL HEMATOMA: Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients treated with SAVAYSA who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture. These hematomas may result in long-term or permanent paralysis. Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures ( 5.4 ).<br>A.

Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include: use of indwelling epidural catheters concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), platelet inhibitors, other anticoagulants a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal punctures a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery optimal timing between the administration of SAVAYSA and neuraxial procedures is not known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurological impairment. If neurological compromise is noted, urgent treatment is necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] .
