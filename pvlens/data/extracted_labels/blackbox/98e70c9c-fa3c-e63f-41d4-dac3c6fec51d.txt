Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse TARGINIQ TM ER exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess each patient’s risk prior to prescribing TARGINIQ ER and monitor all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )].<br>Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of TARGINIQ ER. Monitor for respiratory depression, especially during initiation of TARGINIQ ER or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow TARGINIQ ER tablets whole; crushing, chewing, or dissolving TARGINIQ ER tablets can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] .<br>Accidental Ingestion Accidental ingestion of even one dose of TARGINIQ ER, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxycodone [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] .<br>Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Prolonged use of TARGINIQ ER during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] .<br>Cytochrome P450 3A4 Interaction The concomitant use of TARGINIQ ER with all cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentrations, which could increase or prolong adverse drug effects and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression. In addition, discontinuation of a concomitantly used cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer may result in an increase in oxycodone plasma concentration. Monitor patients receiving TARGINIQ ER and any CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] .<br>Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] .<br>WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME; CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES AND OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS<br>See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.<br><content styleCode="bold">WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY<br>DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME;<br>CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH<br>BENZODIAZEPINES OR OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS</content><br>                   <br>  Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse TARGINIQ TM ER exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death.

Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Reserve concomitant prescribing of TARGINIQ ER Injection and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. WARNING: ADDICTION, ABUSE, AND MISUSE; LIFE-THREATENING RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; ACCIDENTAL INGESTION; NEONATAL OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME; CYTOCHROME P450 3A4 INTERACTION; and RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH BENZODIAZEPINES AND OTHER CNS DEPRESSANTS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. TARGINIQ ER exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess patient’s risk before prescribing and monitor regularly for these behaviors and conditions. ( 5.1 ) Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or following a dose increase. Instruct patients to swallow TARGINIQ ER tablets whole to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal dose of oxycodone. ( 5.2 ) Accidental ingestion of TARGINIQ ER, especially by children, can result in a fatal overdose of oxycodone. ( 5.2 ) Prolonged use of TARGINIQ ER during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. If prolonged opioid use is required in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. ( 5.3 ) Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) can result in a fatal overdose of oxycodone. ( 5.4 ) Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.
