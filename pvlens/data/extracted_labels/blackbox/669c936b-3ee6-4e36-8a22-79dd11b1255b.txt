WARNING: RISK OF HEART FAILURE See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. • CAMZYOS can cause heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. ( 5.1 ) • Echocardiogram assessments of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) required before and during CAMZYOS use. ( 2.1 ) • Initiation in patients with LVEF <55% not recommended. Interrupt if LVEF <50% or if worsening clinical status. ( 2.1 , 5.1 ) • Certain CYP450 inhibitors and inducers are contraindicated in patients taking CAMZYOS because of an increased risk of heart failure. ( 4 , 5.2 , 7 ) • CAMZYOS is available only through a restricted program called the CAMZYOS REMS Program. ( 5.3 )
