CERDELGA is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor indicated for the long-term treatment of adult patients with Gaucher disease type 1 who are CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate metabolizers (IMs), or poor metabolizers (PMs) as detected by an FDA-cleared test. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use : CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers may not achieve adequate concentrations of CERDELGA to achieve a therapeutic effect. ( 1 ) A specific dosage cannot be recommended for CYP2D6 indeterminate metabolizers. ( 1 ) Limitations of Use : Patients who are CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers (URMs) may not achieve adequate concentrations of CERDELGA to achieve a therapeutic effect [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . A specific dosage cannot be recommended for those patients whose CYP2D6 genotype cannot be determined (indeterminate metabolizers) [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .
