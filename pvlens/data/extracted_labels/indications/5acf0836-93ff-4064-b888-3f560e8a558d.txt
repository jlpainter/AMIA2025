( 1.2 ) • Treatment of acute heart failure to reduce left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, peripheral vascular resistance and mean arterial blood pressure. ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Immediate Reduction of Blood Pressure Sodium nitroprusside is indicated for the immediate reduction of blood pressure of adult and pediatric patients in hypertensive crises. 1.2 Induction and Maintenance of Controlled Hypotension Sodium nitroprusside indicated for induction and maintenance of controlled hypotension in adults and children during surgery, to reduce bleeding. 1.3 Treatment of Acute Heart Failure Sodium nitroprusside is indicated for the treatment of acute heart failure to reduce, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, peripheral vascular resistance and mean arterial blood pressure.
