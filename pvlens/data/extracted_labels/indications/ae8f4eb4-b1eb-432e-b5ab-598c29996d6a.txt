The aspirin component of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA is indicated for: reducing the combined risk of death and nonfatal stroke in patients who have had ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain due to fibrin platelet emboli, reducing the combined risk of death and nonfatal MI in patients with a previous MI or unstable angina pectoris, reducing the combined risk of MI and sudden death in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, use in patients who have undergone revascularization procedures (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft [CABG] or Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty [PTCA]) when there is a pre-existing condition for which aspirin is already indicated. The omeprazole component of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA is indicated for decreasing the risk of developing aspirin-associated gastric ulcers in patients at risk for developing aspirin-associated gastric ulcers due to age (≥ 55) or documented history of gastric ulcers. ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA is a combination of aspirin, an anti-platelet agent, and omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), indicated for patients who require aspirin for secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and who are at risk of developing aspirin associated gastric ulcers. The aspirin component of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA is indicated for: reducing the combined risk of death and nonfatal stroke in patients who have had ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain due to fibrin platelet emboli, reducing the combined risk of death and nonfatal MI in patients with a previous MI or unstable angina pectoris, reducing the combined risk of MI and sudden death in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, use in patients who have undergone revascularization procedures (Coronary Artery Bypass Graft [CABG] or Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty [PTCA]) when there is a pre-existing condition for which aspirin is already indicated. The omeprazole component of ASPIRIN AND OMEPRAZOLE DELAYED-RELEASE TABLETSA is indicated for decreasing the risk of developing aspirin associated gastric ulcers in patients at risk for developing aspirin-associated gastric ulcers due to age (≥ 55) or documented history of gastric ulcers.
